## Study Guide: High-Probability “Other Blocks” Trading with Liquidity Concepts

### Key concepts to understand
- Other Block (OB): A price area where a strong order block exists that can act as a reference for high-probability entries. In this material, OB is the focus for identifying favorable entries after liquidity moves.
- Liquidity sweep: A move that "clears out" resting liquidity (stop orders, clusters of orders) before the market returns to a target area. A sweep often precedes a break of structure.
- Break of Structure (BOS): A clear change in market direction shown by a new swing high or swing low that breaches the previous structure.
- Change of Character (CoC): Indication of a shift in market behavior (often shown by a price action change) signaling a potential new move; labeled as X in the explanations (e.g., a change of character rather than a simple BOS).
- Inducement (Inducement zone / inducement pattern): A setup where the market creates a smaller move (often a bottom or top) that seems to lure traders to enter at a suboptimal OB, only to reverse and move to the main OB. In this guide, inducement is used to describe a pullback that tempts traders before the main move resumes.
- Engine liquidity: A form of liquidity behavior where price action returns to take liquidity from a specific zone before continuing in the intended direction. This is often described together with the concept of inducement in the examples.
- IDM (Inducement / Inducement-driven Liquidity with IDM): A labeling to indicate the inducement setup with liquidity concepts. It signals entry opportunities that arise after inducement and liquidity sweeps.

### High-probability entry concept (overall flow)
1. Identify liquidity sweep targets: Look for price levels where there was a significant sweep of liquidity (the area where resting orders were cleared).
2. Confirm a break of structure (BOS) in the direction of the trade after the liquidity sweep.
3. Look for a second sweep or inducement interaction near the OB before entering.
4. Enter in alignment with the OB, aiming for a clear risk-to-reward setup.
5. Use the relevant time-frame relationships to set stops and targets (see entry rules below).

### Diagrammatic patterns to recognize (bullish and bearish)
- Bullish pattern (simplified):
  - Liquidity in a lower region sweeps upward.
  - A BOS to the upside occurs after the liquidity sweep.
  - The OB (other block) is located nearby; inducement may occur around it.
  - A secondary liquidity sweep or inducement zone can appear before price moves higher.

- Bearish pattern (simplified):
  - Liquidity is swept in the upper region and price trends downward.
  - A BOS to the downside occurs after the initial sweep.
  - An OB is located lower; inducement patterns may lure traders before the move resumes to the downside.

### Inducement and engine liquidity concepts (practical intuition)
- Inducement: The market creates a retracement that looks like the place to enter, but it is a trap designed to clear out buyers/sellers before the main move to the OB is completed.
- Engine liquidity: The primary liquidity target moving to or from the OB; price action uses this liquidity to fuel a stronger move toward the OB or the next target.

### Entry setup logic (step-by-step)
- Step 1: Identify a liquidity sweep area using a TR-style reference line or a liquidity model you are comfortable with.
- Step 2: Look for a BOS in the direction of the intended move (up for bullish, down for bearish) after the liquidity sweep.
- Step 3: Locate the OB (the high-probability block) and observe whether inducement or engine liquidity patterns form around it.
- Step 4: If inducement appears (a bottom in a bullish case, or a top in a bearish case) near the OB, wait for the market to react to the inducement and then enter on the expected move toward/through the OB.
- Step 5: Define entry, stop loss, and profit targets:
  - Entry: Typically near the OB or after the inducement has shown a clear path to the OB.
  - Stop: Just beyond a logical failure point (e.g., a pullback beyond a recent swing, or a fixed ATR-based distance around the OB).
  - Take profit/target: Liquidity-related targets (e.g., sweep of liquidity zones, next OB, or a measured move distance). In the guidance, targets are described as “time two of the OB” for certain time frames, or a defined distance to a known liquidity zone.
- Step 6: Time-frame rules:
  - 15-minute charts: Use OB and the corresponding two-times distance target from the OB.
  - 5-minute charts: Similar concept, but scaled down (two-times OB distance on the smaller time frame).
  - 1-hour charts: Use OB plus roughly half of the OB as the target range, adjusting for volatility.

### Practical diagrams and labeling you should be able to reproduce
- Draw an OB block on the chart and label it OB.
- Draw a TR-style liquidity line or region showing the sweep (yours may be a simple horizontal line under/over the OB depending on bullish/bearish context).
- Mark BOS after liquidity sweep (an upward swing high broken in a bullish context, or a downward swing low in a bearish context).
- Indicate inducement area (a smaller retracement making traders think price will move into the OB but then the price reverses away from the inducement toward the main OB or the next target).
- For engine liquidity (IDM context), show a subsequent move that resembles a near-miss to the OB before continuation, labeling the zone as engine liquidity.

### Entry examples (summary, not exhaustive)
- Bullish example (simplified):
  - Liquidity sweep occurs in a lower region.
  - BOS to the upside forms after the sweep.
  - OB is nearby; inducement forms around the OB area.
  - Enter on a move after the inducement zone or on a clear pullback toward the OB with a defined stop and target at the next liquidity zone or OB.
- Bearish example (simplified):
  - Liquidity sweep occurs at the top region.
  - BOS to the downside forms after the sweep.
  - OB is lower; inducement can appear near the OB.
  - Entry occurs after inducement resolves, with the target at the next lower liquidity zone or OB.

### Risk management and position sizing mindset
- Always aim for high-probability entries, not every potential OB signal.
- Use a minimum of 1:2 risk-to-reward (often aiming for 1:3 or better) by targeting liquidity zones or OBs that justify the risk.
- Time-frame considerations: The size of the target should scale with the time frame you are trading (e.g., 1-hour charts may justify larger targets; 5-minute charts require tighter risk control).
- Use clear stop placement: place stops just beyond a logical failed level (e.g., beyond the last swing or beyond the inducement region that is not supposed to hold).

### Operational tips
- Take screenshots of diagrams you study to help memorize the patterns.
- Practice by mapping the OB, BOS, liquidity sweeps, and inducement zones on chart images or paper charts.
- Revisit liquidity concepts (sweeps, engine liquidity, inducement) regularly; these patterns repeat across markets.
- Subscribe to the creator’s channel or join the free Telegram/Community for ongoing setups and updates.
- Remember: The psychology behind the moves matters more than the exact labeling. The OB and the liquidity interaction are the core drivers, while the labels (BOS, CoC, IDM) aid memory and analysis.

Recommended study steps
- Watch the video walk-throughs multiple times to visually memorize the patterns.
- Practice identifying:
  - A clear liquidity sweep
  - A BOS in the direction of the move
  - An OB nearby with possible inducement or engine liquidity
- Create a personal cheat sheet or a diagram template with:
  - OB location
  - Liquidity sweep zone
  - BOS occurrence
  - Inducement/Engine liquidity notes
  - Entry, stop, and target guidelines
- When ready, test the model in simulated trading or with small live trades to build confidence.

- Reinforce the trigger logic around breaker blocks to enhance high-probability trade setups.

### Notes on using this guide
- The guide reflects a structured approach to interpret price action around liquidity and order blocks with an emphasis on high-probability entries.
- If you want more clarity, revisit the supplied diagrams and examples in the original video, and use the suggested screenshot practice to capture each pattern.
