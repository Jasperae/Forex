## Study Guide: Market Structure, Break of Structure, Change of Character, and Shift of Market Structure

### Purpose
- Learn the basic concepts to identify whoa points in price action that indicate changes in trend and continuation patterns.
- Terms to know: Break of Structure (BOS), Change of Character (COC or CC), Shift of Market Structure (SMS).
- Use these concepts to gain an edge in trading by recognizing structure changes and potential pullbacks or continuations.

### Key Definitions
- Break of Structure (BOS)
  - A break of a previous high (in an uptrend) or a previous low (in a downtrend).
  - Signals that the current pattern may be weakening or a reversal/relocation of the trend could be starting.
  - In uptrends: break of the last swing high.
  - In downtrends: break of the last swing low.
- Change of Character (COC or CC)
  - A move that changes the market direction (trend) from up to down, or from down to up.
  - Often involves a break of the previous trend structure followed by a retracement and a new impulse in the opposite direction.
  - Indicates the market is transitioning to a new trend regime (e.g., from bullish to bearish, or vice versa).
- Shift of Market Structure (SMS)
  - A subtle form of structure shift indicating weakness and a continuation/shift in the trend.
  - Conceptually often occurs before a Change of Character.
  - SMS can be observed as a failure to push to a higher high (in an uptrend) or failure to push to a lower low (in a downtrend), signaling potential momentum shift toward the opposite direction.

### Core Concepts and How to Identify Them on a Chart
- Price action basics
  - Uptrend is characterized by Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL).
  - Downtrend is characterized by Lower Low (LL) and Lower High (LH).
- Break of Structure (BOS) in an uptrend
  - Locate the last swing high.
  - When price closes below that high (or breaks below the previous swing low depending on the charting convention), mark BOS.
- Break of Structure (BOS) in a downtrend
  - Locate the last swing low.
  - When price closes above that low (or breaks above the previous swing high depending on convention), mark BOS.
- Change of Character (COC/CC)
  - After a BOS in the direction of a prior trend, price often retraces toward a significant area (POI, liquidity, value area) and then commits to a new direction.
  - Example: In an uptrend, a strong BOS followed by a retracement and a move below/through a critical high can signify a change to a downtrend.
  - In a downtrend, a BOS followed by retracement then a move above a critical low can signify a change to an uptrend.
- Shift of Market Structure (SMS)
  - Observed when the market structure begins to weaken in the current trend without an immediate complete reversal.
  - Example (uptrend): Price makes a new higher high but fails to push beyond and then retraces; sentiment shifts toward potential downside, indicating a shift in structure toward a possible reversal or deeper correction.
  - Example (downtrend): Price makes a new lower low but then retraces and fails to set a new lower low, indicating a potential shift toward an uptrend.

### Practical Guidelines and How to Mark on Charts
- In an Uptrend
  - Identify the last higher high (HH).
  - Look for BOS if price closes below that HH (i.e., breaks structure).
  - After BOS, watch for CHoC (Change of Character) signals: retracement to a value area or liquidity pool, then a move lower to indicate potential trend change.
  - If the price retraces and makes a new lower high and then breaks a previous high, you may see a change of character leading to a downtrend.
- In a Downtrend
  - Identify the last lower low (LL).
  - Look for BOS if price breaks above that LL (i.e., breaks structure).
  - After BOS, observe for CHoC: retracement to a local POI, then a move higher to indicate potential trend change to uptrend.
  - If price retraces and creates a higher high and then breaks below, you may see a change of character toward an uptrend.
- Where to place markers
  - You can place BOS markers at or inside the area where the break occurs. Some traders put the BOS label above the arrow; others place it inside the structure area. Consistency is key.
- Relation to liquidity/POI
  - CO C often involves retracement to liquidity zones, order blocks, or points of interest (POIs). These are common targets for the retracement before the next directional move.

### Simple Scenarios to Visualize
- Uptrend BOS and COC
  - Price forms HH and HL (uptrend).
  - Price makes a new HH and then breaks the previous HH (BOS).
  - Price retraces to a POI and then starts moving lower, indicating a possible CHoC and shift toward a downtrend.
- Downtrend BOS and COC
  - Price forms LL and LH (downtrend).
  - Price breaks above the previous LL (BOS in a downtrend context).
  - Price retraces to a POI and then starts moving higher, indicating a possible CHoC and shift toward an uptrend.
- SMS in both directions
  - SMS can appear as a subtle weakening signal before a CHoC; it often occurs before the actual change in trend and is used to anticipate a potential reversal.

### Study Techniques
- Take screenshots or annotate charts to identify:
  - HH, HL, LH, LL levels.
  - The last swing high and swing low for BOS opportunities.
  - Points where CHoC/crossing of trend direction occurs.
  - Potential SMS warning signs (weakness before a clear break).
- Practice with both uptrend and downtrend charts:
  - Mark BOS occurrences.
  - Mark subsequent CHoC events and the resulting trend direction.
  - Note any SMS signals that preceded a CP (change of trend).
- Cross-reference with liquidity or POI zones to reinforce understanding of why retracements occur.

### Practice Tasks
- Task 1: In an uptrend chart, identify the last swing high. Mark a BOS when price breaks that high. Then identify a potential Change of Character with a retracement and reversal pattern toward a downtrend.
- Task 2: In a downtrend chart, identify the last swing low. Mark a BOS when price breaks above that low. Then identify a potential Change of Character with a retracement and reversal pattern toward an uptrend.
- Task 3: Look for SMS signals in both directions. Note where price shows a subtle shift in structure before a clear BOS or CHoC occurs.

### Note on Terminology and Notation
- The video uses various notations for CHoC (COC), e.g., CH, CC, or X; choose one consistent label in your own notes.
- SMS is explicitly “Shift of Market Structure” and is described as a precursor to a change of character in many cases.
- BOS (Breaker of Structure) is sometimes abbreviated as BOS or marked inside the structure area; pick one convention and stay consistent.

### Summary of Takeaways
- Break of Structure (BOS) marks a key point where the current swing structure is violated (in uptrends: previous HH; in downtrends: previous LL).
- Change of Character (COC) indicates a decisive shift in trend direction (up to down, or down to up) after a significant move and retracement.
- Shift of Market Structure (SMS) signals a weakening of the current trend’s momentum and often precedes a Change of Character.
- Understanding and correctly identifying BOS, COC, and SMS helps you spot potential trend continuations and reversals more reliably.
- Practice by labeling HH/LH/HL/LL, BOS points, CHoC events, and SMS signals on real charts to build intuition.

- What the video covers
  - Market structure concepts: Break of Structure (BOS), Change of Character (CH/CC), and Shift of Market Structure (SMS).
  - How these concepts help gain an edge and stay profitable.
  - Practical examples on uptrends and downtrends, plus how to mark on charts.

- Key terminology on price action
  - Higher High (HH) and Higher Low (HL) indicate uptrends.
  - Lower Low (LL) and Lower High (LH) indicate downtrends.
  - Break of Structure (BOS): a break of the previous high (in an uptrend) or the previous low (in a downtrend).

- Break of Structure (BOS)
  - Definition: the price breaks the last high in an uptrend or the last low in a downtrend.
  - How to spot: identify the last high/low and mark a BOS where price breaks past it.
  - Visual: arrows/labels used to show BOS on chart (inside or on top, depending on preference).
  - Examples: BOS occurs both in uptrends (break of previous high) and in downtrends (break of previous low).

- Change of Character (CH/CC)
  - Definition: a move that changes the market from one trend direction to the opposite (uptrend to downtrend or downtrend to uptrend).
  - How to spot: after an uptrend, a retracement followed by sustained new direction downward marks a CH; similarly for the opposite.
  - Relationship to BOS: CH often follows a BOS and is accompanied by retracement/POI (points of interest) and liquidity areas.

- Shift of Market Structure (SMS)
  - Definition: a “weakness/continuation” signal indicating the market is shifting sentiment and preparing for a new trend direction.
  - Typical place: often occurs before a Change of Character.
  - How it looks: price behavior near higher highs (in uptrends) or lower lows (in downtrends) without breaking them, followed by a shift in direction.
  - Purpose: indicates early signs of a potential trend change, used in conjunction with CH and BOS.

- How to apply in analysis
  - Mark BOS in both uptrends and downtrends to identify breaks of prior highs/lows.
  - Look for CH after BOS as the trend direction changes (up to down or down to up).
  - Watch for SMS as an adjacent signal that the current structure may be weakening and a CH could follow.
  - Retracements often occur to value zones or liquidity areas after a CH, providing potential entry points.

- Practical tips from the video
  - You can annotate charts with BOS labels (BOS) and CH markers (CH/C) and optionally SMS.
  - Screenshots and additional visuals are provided in associated materials and on their X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram channels.

Study Guide: Market Structure, Breaks, and Fake Breaks (Fake BOS and Fake C)

Purpose of video series
- Learn market structure (structure and substructure) and how to identify genuine vs. fake breaks.
- Emphasizes analyzing on higher timeframes first, using lower timeframes for confirmation.
- Focus: uptrends and downtrends, break of structure, change of character, liquidity concepts, and practical entry thinking.

Key terms and definitions
- Structure (market structure): The visible order of highs and lows in the price on a given timeframe.
  - Uptrend structure: Higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL).
  - Downtrend structure: Lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL).
- Substructure: The market structure observed on a lower timeframe (a “structure inside the higher-timeframe structure”).
- Break of Structure (BOS): A move that violates the current trend’s previous high/low, signaling a potential continuation in the trend direction.
  - Uptrend BOS: Price breaks above a previous high.
  - Downtrend BOS: Price breaks below a previous low.
- Change of Character (CoC): A shift in the market’s price action that indicates a potential shift in trend direction, not just a simple BOS. It often involves breaking a high and then breaking a previous low (or vice versa) to confirm a new direction.
- Fake BOS (fake Break of Structure): A false signal of a BOS observed on a lower timeframe that does not represent a true shift in the higher-timeframe structure.
- Fake C/Change of Character (fake CoC): A deceptive change on a lower timeframe where the market appears to change character but hasn’t actually broken the significant highs/lows needed on the higher timeframe.
- POI (Point of Interest): A price level where traders expect liquidity and potential reaction (liquidity pocket, liquidity target, liquidity trap, or liquidity grab).
- Liquidity (conceptual): Areas where orders accumulate; price often returns to clear liquidity before continuing.
- Timeframes: Trading decisions should be aligned with a chosen primary timeframe and confirm on lower timeframes.
  - Examples: Daily (D), 4-hour (H4), 1-hour (H1), 15-minute (M15), etc.
  - Swing traders: Typically use daily or 4-hour as the main frame; confirm on lower frames (H1, M15) as needed.
  - Position traders: May use even longer horizons (weekly, monthly).

Core concepts explained

1) Structure vs. Substructure
- Higher timeframe structure shows the main trend (e.g., a clear uptrend with HH and HL).
- Substructure is the same idea but observed on a lower timeframe. It can show smaller uptrends within the larger trend.
- Do not blur frames: analyze the main structure on your chosen timeframe, then use the lower timeframe only for confirmation.

2) Break of Structure (BOS) and Change of Character (CoC)
- Genuine BOS on the higher timeframe confirms the continuation or shift of the trend (e.g., price breaks a prior high in an uptrend).
- Change of Character is a broader concept indicating a potential trend shift. It often involves more than one action (e.g., breaking the previous high and then breaking a lower low) to confirm a real shift.

3) Fake BOS and Fake CoC on lower timeframes
- Fake BOS: Occurs on the substructure (lower timeframe) when price appears to break structure but it’s just a temporary move within the main trend. It often acts as a liquidity grab or a “trap” that does not constitute a true break of the higher timeframe structure.
- Fake CoC: A misinterpreted change of character on a lower timeframe where the higher timeframe structure is not actually shifting. It can look like the market is changing direction but often only creates liquidity or a minor counter-move.

4) How to identify genuine vs. fake moves
- Always anchor your main trading decisions to the higher timeframe structure.
- If a potential BOS is observed on a lower timeframe, verify on the higher timeframe whether the overall structure supports that move.
- A true CoC typically requires securing a real break of the prior extreme (e.g., breaking the last high in an uptrend and then breaking the prior low to confirm a new regime). Without that, the move may be a fake CoC or liquidity-driven pause.

5) Liquidity and price action context
- Price often returns to locations where liquidity exists (liquidity pockets, POIs).
- When price moves into a POI or liquidity zone, there can be a pullback or consolidation before continuing. This is a common context for fake moves and for the market to “clear liquidity.”

6) Timeframe discipline
- Do not chase structure across multiple timeframes simultaneously.
- Identify the main structure on your chosen timeframe (e.g., daily for swing traders).
- Move to a lower timeframe (e.g., 4-hour, 1-hour) strictly for entry confirmation, not for redefining the main structure.
- Different traders use different timeframes; the speaker emphasizes that timeframes are subjective and traders should find what fits their style (scalpers vs. swing vs. position traders).

7) Practical entry approach (summary)
- Step 1: Determine the main structure on your primary timeframe (HH, HL for uptrend; LH, LL for downtrend).
- Step 2: Observe for a genuine BOS on the primary timeframe.
- Step 3: If using a lower timeframe to refine entries, look for confirmatory signals there, but do not rely on fake moves on the lower timeframe to redefine your main structure.
- Step 4: Consider liquidity zones and POIs as potential targets or areas to observe for reactions.
- Step 5: Practice with both uptrends and downtrends to recognize what constitutes a proper CoC vs. a fake CoC.

Common mistakes discussed
- Peeping into multiple timeframes too aggressively; the main decision should be on a single timeframe, with lower timeframes used for confirmation.
- Mistaking a lower-timeframe uptrend (within the higher-timeframe uptrend) as a structural break.
- Entering trades based on fake BOS or fake CoC signals on the substructure without confirming on the higher timeframe.
- Failing to recognize liquidity traps and POIs as potential reasons for pullbacks.

Guidance on example scenarios (conceptual)
- Uptrend example:
  - Main structure on the higher timeframe shows HH and HL. A true BOS occurs when a new high is broken on the main timeframe after a pullback.
  - A fake BOS on a lower timeframe might look like price pushes higher briefly, but it does not cause a new higher high on the higher timeframe; instead, it often returns to collect liquidity.
  - A true Change of Character on the downward leg would require breaking the previous high to confirm potential upward shift, or breaking a lower low to confirm continuing downtrend depending on direction.

- Downtrend example:
  - Main structure shows LL and LH. A genuine BOS occurs when price breaks below a previous low on the main timeframe.
  - A fake CoC on a lower timeframe would attempt to show a downward shift but fails to break the key lower low needed on the higher timeframe.
  - Correct CoC on a downtrend would involve a sequence where the price forms a lower low and then breaks a lower high to confirm a continued downtrend, possibly forming a POI for continuation.

Study tips
- Watch the entire series in order to understand T2U, structures, substructures, and how fake moves fit into the framework.
- Use one main timeframe for structure. Use lower timeframes for entry confirmation and to observe potential liquidity and POIs.
- Practice drawing and labeling HH/HL/LH/LL, BOS levels, and potential CoC on both a higher timeframe and a lower timeframe to internalize the concept.
- Review examples of true vs. fake BOS and true vs. fake CoC carefully to differentiate them in real-time trading.
- Join community calls or discussions (as suggested) to reinforce concepts and get feedback.

Practice questions
1) Define structure and substructure in your own words. How do they relate across timeframes?
2) What differentiates a genuine Break of Structure from a fake BOS on a lower timeframe?
3) What constitutes a Change of Character, and how does it differ from a fake Change of Character?
4) Describe a scenario where a fake BOS may lure a trader into a trade. How would you validate it on a higher timeframe?
5) Why is it important to anchor trading decisions on the higher timeframe, and only use lower timeframes for confirmation?
6) Explain how liquidity and POIs influence price action after a BOS or CoC.
7) Given a daily uptrend with a recent pullback, outline a step-by-step approach to identify a potential long entry using the concepts of BOS and fake moves.

How to study and engage further
- Re-watch the video to reinforce the diagrams and described sequences.
- Practice with real charts: identify primary structure on your chosen timeframe, then scan substructures on nearby lower timeframes for potential fake moves vs. genuine BOS/CoC.
- Engage with the community (as suggested): discuss weekly calls, share annotated charts, and ask questions if anything is unclear.

Notes on practical application
- The speaker emphasizes profitability comes from proper structure understanding and disciplined timeframe alignment, not from chasing every micro-move on lower timeframes.
- The goal is to recognize how the market builds liquidity, tests POIs, and how to differentiate real structural shifts from liquidity-driven pullbacks.
- This study guide captures the concepts needed to proceed through the rest of the series, where confirm setups and specific entry rules will be covered in more depth.

- Topic: Market structure 7 – focusing on fake break of structure (fake BOS) and fake change of character (fake C).
- Core definitions:
  - Structure vs. substructure: structure is the market pattern on a higher time frame; substructure is the same concept on a lower time frame (structure inside a structure).
  - Higher highs / higher lows describe an uptrend; the opposite describes a downtrend.
  - Break of structure (BOS): when a higher high is broken to the upside, or a lower low is broken to the downside.
  - Change of character (C): a shift in the market’s behavior/character, signaling a potential trend change.
- Fake BOS and fake C (fake changes):
  - Fake BOS: occurs on a lower time frame; looks like a BOS on that frame but is not a true BOS on the higher time frame. Often a small up-move that doesn’t take out a real high on the higher time frame.
  - Fake C: also occurs on a substructure; market shows a temporary change of character but fails to properly break the previous major high/low, thus trapping liquidity.
- How to read and avoid fakes:
  - Always identify the main (higher time frame) break of structure first, then check on the lower time frame for confirmations.
  - Do not chase fake breaks seen on a lower time frame as if they were the main BOS/C. Use the higher time frame as the primary reference.
  - Fake C proper vs. improper:
    - Proper C on an uptrend: must first break the existing high, then break the low to complete the character shift.
    - Improper C: market does not break the prior high before forming a lower low; can be liquidity trapping (SMC liquidity) rather than a real change in character.
- Time frames and trading approach:
  - Different traders operate on different time frames (1 day, 4 hours, 1 hour, 15 minutes, etc.).
  - Swing traders typically use daily to 4-hour time frames; confirm entries on lower frames (1H, 15M) after identifying a main BOS/C on the higher frame.
  - Don’t over-analyze multiple frames simultaneously; anchor your analysis on the main time frame and use lower frames only for confirmation.
- Practical notes:
  - Liquidity and liquidity traps: many fake moves are created to sweep liquidity before continuing; be mindful of liquidity zones near the highs/lows.
  - On uptrends, watch for fake C that doesn’t properly break the prior high before breaking the low.
  - On downtrends, the proper C occurs with a move that first breaks the lower high, then the lower low, before continuing.
- Additional guidance:
  - Practice drawing BOS and C on charts to distinguish proper vs. fake moves.
  - Use weekly calls and community discussions to reinforce understanding.
  - The creator emphasizes revisiting videos in the series for a complete understanding and staying subscribed for updates.

- Card 3
  - Q: What is the main market structure on an uptrend?
  - A: Higher highs and higher lows.

- Card 4
  - Q: Why is “fake BOS” called “fake”?
  - A: It appears as a break of structure on a lower time frame but is not the actual break on the higher time frame; it’s a false signal.

- Card 5
  - Q: On which timeframe do fake BOS and fake C typically occur?
  - A: On a lower time frame than the one you’re trading (the substructure).

- Card 6
  - Q: What should you do with time frames when analyzing structure?
  - A: Focus on one time frame for main analysis (e.g., 1-hour or daily) and use lower time frames only for confirmatory entries; avoid peeping across many time frames.

- Card 7
  - Q: How does a real break of structure happen on an uptrend?
  - A: A higher high is broken to the upside, followed by a pullback or continuation; this is the major break of structure.

- Card 8
  - Q: What is liquidity in the context of fake BOS/C?
  - A: Areas where orders accumulate (like liquidity pools) that can cause the price to pull back or retest before continuing.

- Card 9
  - Q: What is a false (fake) change of character?
  - A: A scenario where the price does not actually break the prior high (in an uptrend) or prior low (in a downtrend) but fakes the change of character, often to create liquidity traps.

- Card 10
  - Q: How can you identify a proper change of character on an uptrend?
  - A: The price must first break the previous high, then come down to break the low (creating a visible shift in market character).

- Card 11
  - Q: How can you identify a fake change of character?
  - A: The price moves up and down without actually breaking the prior high, or breaks the high and then doesn’t break the next low as expected, forming a liquidity trap.

- Card 12
  - Q: What is a “P.O.I.” in this context?
  - A: Point of Interest (a price area where liquidity may be absorbed or where you may consider entries).

- Card 13
  - Q: In an uptrend, what would a typical fake C look like on a lower time frame?
  - A: The market goes up, comes down to retest or approach the high but does not form a proper higher high; it may just create a liquidity sweep before continuing.

- Card 14
  - Q: In a downtrend, what would a proper change of character look like?
  - A: The price breaks a lower low, then breaks a lower high to confirm the shift, before continuing down.

- Card 15
  - Q: What is the recommended approach to trading a fake BOS or fake C?
  - A: Understand the concept on the higher time frame, confirm on a lower time frame, and avoid entering based solely on the fake signal; wait for the proper break on the main frame.

- Card 16
  - Q: What is the role of liquidity traps in this discussion?
  - A: They can cause price to reverse or revert to collect liquidity before continuing the main move; recognizing them helps avoid false entries.

- Card 17
  - Q: What is the difference between a real break of structure and a liquidity trap?
  - A: A real break of structure is a clear break of the prior high/low on the main timeframe, whereas a liquidity trap is a false move that forms liquidity without a genuine structural break.

- Card 18
  - Q: Why is it important to trade with the main break of structure on the higher time frame?
  - A: It reduces the likelihood of entering on false signals generated by fake BOS/C on lower time frames.

- Card 19
  - Q: What lesson is given about time frames regarding "swing" vs "scalping"?
  - A: Swing traders typically use daily to 4-hour time frames; scalpers may use shorter frames like 30 minutes to 1 hour; the key is to know your own time frame and not mix them up.

- Card 20
  - Q: What should you do after learning the concept in this video?
  - A: Revise the video, practice identifying real vs fake BOS/C, join the Telegram community for discussions and weekly calls, and continue to the next videos in the series.

- Card 21
  - Q: What is the recommended flow for analyzing structure in a trade setup?
  - A: Determine the larger trend and main break of structure on a higher time frame, then use lower time frames to find confirmatory entries, being mindful of potential fake signals on the substructure.- Card 1

  - A: On a lower time frame than the one you’re trading (the substructure).

- Card 6
  - Q: What should you do with time frames when analyzing structure?
  - A: Focus on one time frame for main analysis (e.g., 1-hour or daily) and use lower time frames only for confirmatory entries; avoid peeping across many time frames.

- Card 7
  - Q: How does a real break of structure happen on an uptrend?
  - A: A higher high is broken to the upside, followed by a pullback or continuation; this is the major break of structure.

  - Q: What is liquidity in the context of fake BOS/C?
  - A: Areas where orders accumulate (like liquidity pools) that can cause the price to pull back or retest before continuing.

- Card 9
  - Q: What is a false (fake) change of character?
  - A: A scenario where the price does not actually break the prior high (in an uptrend) or prior low (in a downtrend) but fakes the change of character, often to create liquidity traps.

- Card 10
  - Q: How can you identify a proper change of character on an uptrend?
  - A: The price must first break the previous high, then come down to break the low (creating a visible shift in market character).

- Card 11
  - Q: How can you identify a fake change of character?
  - A: The price moves up and down without actually breaking the prior high, or breaks the high and then doesn’t break the next low as expected, forming a liquidity trap.

- Card 12
  - Q: What is a “P.O.I.” in this context?
  - A: Point of Interest (a price area where liquidity may be absorbed or where you may consider entries).

- Card 13
  - Q: In an uptrend, what would a typical fake C look like on a lower time frame?
  - A: The market goes up, comes down to retest or approach the high but does not form a proper higher high; it may just create a liquidity sweep before continuing.

- Card 14
  - Q: In a downtrend, what would a proper change of character look like?
  - A: The price breaks a lower low, then breaks a lower high to confirm the shift, before continuing down.

- Card 15
  - Q: What is the recommended approach to trading a fake BOS or fake C?
  - A: Understand the concept on the higher time frame, confirm on a lower time frame, and avoid entering based solely on the fake signal; wait for the proper break on the main frame.

- Card 16
  - Q: What is the role of liquidity traps in this discussion?
  - A: They can cause price to reverse or revert to collect liquidity before continuing the main move; recognizing them helps avoid false entries.

- Card 17
  - Q: What is the difference between a real break of structure and a liquidity trap?
  - A: A real break of structure is a clear break of the prior high/low on the main timeframe, whereas a liquidity trap is a false move that forms liquidity without a genuine structural break.

- Card 18
  - Q: Why is it important to trade with the main break of structure on the higher time frame?
  - A: It reduces the likelihood of entering on false signals generated by fake BOS/C on lower time frames.

- Card 19
  - Q: What lesson is given about time frames regarding "swing" vs "scalping"?
  - A: Swing traders typically use daily to 4-hour time frames; scalpers may use shorter frames like 30 minutes to 1 hour; the key is to know your own time frame and not mix them up.

- Card 20
  - Q: What should you do after learning the concept in this video?
  - A: Revise the video, practice identifying real vs fake BOS/C, join the Telegram community for discussions and weekly calls, and continue to the next videos in the series.

- Card 21
  - Q: What is the recommended flow for analyzing structure in a trade setup?
  - A: Determine the larger trend and main break of structure on a higher time frame, then use lower time frames to find confirmatory entries, being mindful of potential fake signals on the substructure.
