## Study Guide: Understanding Risk-Reward (RR) in Trading

### Key concept
- RR stands for Risk to Reward. It represents how much you are willing to risk to potentially gain a certain amount (the reward) on a trade.

### Definitions and setup
- Risk: The amount of money you are willing to lose on a trade.
- Reward: The amount of money you aim to gain if the trade moves in your favor.
- RR ratio is written as “X to Y” (e.g., 1:3, 1:5, 1:10). It compares potential reward to potential risk.
  - Example: 1:3 means you risk 1 unit to make 3 units.

### How to read and apply RR
- If you risk $1, and your RR is 1:3, your target profit (reward) is $3.
- If you risk $5, and your RR is 1:10, your target profit is $50.
- You can scale risk up or down (e.g., $500 risk with 1:10 RR aims for $5,000 reward).

### Practical examples from the video
- A trade with RR 1:3: You risk 1% or $1 (depending on your account size or % risk), aim for 3% or $3 reward.
- A trade with higher RR (e.g., 1:10): You risk $1 to gain $10; or, with $5 risk, you target $50 reward.
- Large account example: If you risk $500 and use a 1:10 RR, you aim for $5,000 reward.

### Important notes
- RR is independent of pip count. Whether you risk 10 pips to gain 30 pips or 100 pips to gain 300 pips, what matters is the ratio (e.g., 1:3 or 1:10).
- The RR ratio remains the same even if you change the absolute amounts; it scales with your risk per trade.
- Some traders focus on pips, but RR helps you understand the actual potential profit relative to risk.

### Position sizing (foreshadowed)
- The next lesson will cover position sizing. It will discuss how to determine how large a trade you should take based on your RR and risk tolerance, with a focus on forex and a note on adapting concepts to crypto.

### Practical trading guidance
- Before entering a trade, know:
  - Your maximum acceptable risk (in $ or % of account).
  - Your target reward (based on RR ratio).
  - Where your stop loss (risk) and take profit (reward) will be placed.
- Do not rely on “partial” takes in this RR concept example (the basic explanation assumes you exit only at TP or SL to illustrate the pure RR effect). In real trading, many traders use partial takes to manage risk or lock in profits.
- Avoid overemphasizing pips alone; focus on the risk-reward balance to know what you are willing to lose to gain a potential reward.

### What to expect next
- A follow-up video will dive into position sizing, with emphasis on applying these RR concepts to forex and adapting to crypto where appropriate.

### What to do with this guide
- Use the RR concept to plan every trade:
  - Decide your risk per trade (e.g., 1% of account or a fixed dollar amount).
  - Choose a reasonable RR (e.g., 1:3, 1:5, 1:10) based on strategy and setup quality.
  - Set stop loss and take profit levels accordingly.
- Practice with different RR ratios to understand how your potential profits scale with risk.
