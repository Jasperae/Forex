### Study Guide: Using Fair Value Gap (FVG), Fibonacci (FIB 2), and Gun Box (G Box) with LTO/OT concepts to Trade

### Purpose
- Learn a structured approach to enter trades in uptrends using a combination of:
  - Fair Value Gap (FVG)
  - Fibonacci retracement levels (FIB 2)
  - G Box (Gun Box) refinements
- Focus on buy entries in uptrends by identifying imbalances and retracements to high-probability zones
- Manage entries, stop loss (SL), and take profit (TP) with a plan to target liquidity

### Key Concepts
- Uptrend identification: Look for higher highs and higher lows to confirm an uptrend before looking for buy setups.
- Imbalance and Fair Value Gap (FVG): A price gap left by a rapid move where the market did not fill in; an FVG zone is a pullback area expected to be revisited.
- FVG zone sizing: Mark FVG zones on the chart (often between a first and third candle weeks’ shadows) to locate retracement targets and entry zones.
- Fibonacci 2 (FIB 2): Apply Fibonacci retracement on the move from the swing low to the swing high within the uptrend; typical retracement regions of interest are the 0.618 to 0.786 (often called the “golden zone”).
- G Box (Gun Box) refinements: A tool to refine entries inside the FVG zone by narrowing to subzones (e.g., 0.5 to 0.0 and 0.5 to 1.0) for more precise entry points.
- Entry refinement tension: FVG + FIB + G Box together can be powerful but may cause “missed entries” if over-refined; balance simplicity and precision.
- Targeting liquidity: Primary TP usually targets the next major liquidity/compensation zone (often a liquidity pool nearby). Consider multiple TPs (TP1, TP2) for partials and then trail.

### Entry Criteria (step-by-step)
1) Confirm uptrend
   - Ensure market structure shows higher highs and higher lows on the chosen timeframe (the video uses a lower time frame like 1-hour for execution but regards the larger trend).

2) Locate an imbalance / FVG
   - Find an area where the price left a gap in the candles (between the week/wicks of consecutive candles), indicating an imbalance and a potential FVG zone.

3) Apply FIB 2 to the swing
   - Draw Fibonacci retracement from the recent swing low to the swing high within the uptrend that contains the FVG.
   - Mark the retracement zone from 0.618 to 0.786 as a likely retracement target where price may return to before resuming the move.

4) Confirm the FVG zone with the FIB1/0.5 or broader view
   - The FVG zone should align visually with the 0.618–0.786 retracement area to give a high-probability entry region.

5) Use G Box for refinement (optional but recommended)
   - Open a G Box inside the FVG zone to further narrow the entry window.
   - Consider using the lower sub-zone of the G Box (e.g., 0 to 0.5 or 0.5 to 0.618) to refine your entry.
   - The idea is to enter around the midpoint of the FVG plus G Box alignment for higher probability.

6) Enter
   - Entry can be limit order within the refined zone (G Box or FVG+FIB overlap). The video describes a limit entry near the bottom of the FVG and/or inside the G Box.

7) Stop Loss (SL) placement
   - Place SL beneath the FVG zone or below a nearby “other block” (support area/candle) for safety.
   - Alternative: place SL slightly below the Fibonacci retracement level (0.5 to 0.618) or just under the FVG zone to be safe.

8) Take Profit (TP) targets
   - TP1: Aiming for the first nearby liquidity/resistance target (often around 1.3x to 1.5x risk; commonly quoted as 1.3 or 1.4 depending on setup).
   - TP2: A higher target (1.5 to 1.6+ depending on structure and risk tolerance) or ride the move toward the next liquidity area.
   - Consider partials at TP1 and move the stop to break-even or to a trailing level if price action supports it.

9) Trade management options
   - Market entry vs. limit entry: Market entries are allowed, but limit entries at your refined zone can improve win rate with less slippage.
   - Partial profit-taking: Take partial profits at TP1, then let the remainder run toward TP2.
   - Break-even: Move stop to break-even after TP1 is hit to protect profits.

### What to Look For in Practice
- Multiple FVGs can appear in a chart; choose the most valid FVG aligned with the major retracement zone (0.618–0.786).
- You may see several imbalances; evaluate if the FVG aligns with Fibonacci retracement and G Box for the best probability.
- Note that aggressive refinements can reduce the number of entries; balancing simplicity and precision is key.

### Risk and Management Considerations
- This method relies on anticipating a retrace to FVG + Fibonacci level; misidentifying the zone or a strong counter-move can cause a loss.
- Without external liquidity ranges, some targets may be speculative; always consider liquidity zones and price behavior.
- Backtest and practice in a demo environment before applying real money; adapt SL levels to your risk tolerance and account size.

### Common Setup Variations Mentioned
- Using the full FVG zone plus FIB 2 region for entry.
- Refining entry using the G Box only inside the FVG to tighten price level (more precise but risk of missing the entry).
- Alternate approach: Enter near the lower boundary of the FVG/G Box overlap and place a stop under the FVG or the nearby support block.

### What to Do Next (Practice Tasks)
- Practice identifying uptrends and FVGs on a handful of charts (e.g., USD pairs or indices).
- Draw FIB retracements from swing lows to highs within the uptrends and mark the 0.618–0.786 zones.
- Mark FVG zones (gaps between candle weeks/wicks) and check how often price returns to these zones.
- Use a G Box (if available) inside the FVG to refine entry points; compare results with and without G Box refinement.
- Place simulated entries (limit orders) in your chosen zone, set SL beneath the FVG area, and plan TP1/TP2 targets as described.
- Analyze results: track win rate, drawdowns, and profit/loss; adjust parameters to fit your risk tolerance and trading style.

### Glossary (quick reference)
- Uptrend: Market structure with higher highs and higher lows.
- Imbalance: A rapid price move creating an unrebalanced area, often left as an FVG.
- Fair Value Gap (FVG): Zone where price likely retraces to “fill” the imbalance.
- Fibonacci Retracement (FIB 2): Tool to identify potential reversal zones; 0.618–0.786 is a key target range.
- G Box (Gun Box): A refinement tool to narrow entry points within a defined zone.
- Liquidity target: Price level where buy/sell liquidity is expected to appear; commonly used as a TP target.
- Market execution vs. limit entry: Market fills immediately at prevailing price; limit enters at a specific price.
