Flashcard 15
Q: What is an “other block” concept mentioned in the video?
A: A price level or zone where a trader may look for price reaction (often used as a potential entry or exit area).

Flashcard 16
Q: How can you manage risk when trading consolidation?
A: Use appropriate stop loss spacing (not too tight), be mindful of liquidity zones, and consider exiting if price nears a major liquidity area with indecision.

Flashcard 17
Q: Why might a trader hold through consolidation during a favorable trend?
A: If the edge (e.g., liquidity dynamics, structure breaks) suggests the price will resume in the desired direction, and the trader has a favorable risk/reward plan.

Flashcard 18
Q: What signals indicate a potential breakout from consolidation?
A: Clear break of structure, a strong price move off a liquidity zone, or a confirmed directional move after indecision.

Flashcard 19

A: Liquidity zones can induce price moves by attracting orders; a breakout can be driven by the liquidity being tapped or swept.

Flashcard 20
Q: What is one key takeaway about consolidation from the video?
A: Consolidation is a valid market condition that can push price in your desired direction if you understand liquidity, structure, and have a solid risk plan.
