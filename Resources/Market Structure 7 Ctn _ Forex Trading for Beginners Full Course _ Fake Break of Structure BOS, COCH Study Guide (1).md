Study Guide: Fake Break of Structure (Fake BOS) and Fake Change of Character (Fake C)

Core concepts
- Market structure and substructure
  - Market structure: the overall price action on your chosen higher time frame (e.g., uptrend with higher highs and higher lows).
  - Substructure: the price action on a lower time frame (a “structure inside” the main structure).
- Break of Structure (BOS)
  - In an uptrend, a true BOS occurs when a higher high is broken to the upside.
  - In a downtrend, a true BOS occurs when a lower low is broken to the downside.
- Change of Character (C)
  - A change in market character occurs when the trend’s current behavior shifts (e.g., from higher highs/lows to a different pattern), indicating a potential new phase of the move.
  - Proper Change of Character (C) should involve breaking the relevant prior extreme (e.g., for uptrends: break the high, then break the low to confirm the shift).
- Fake BOS and Fake C
  - Fake BOS: a supposed break on a substructure/timeframe that does not reflect a real, higher-timeframe BOS. Often caused by observing only the lower-timeframe moves.
  - Fake C: a supposed change of character that does not properly break the key level (e.g., does not break the prior high on an uptrend or does not break the prior low on a downtrend). This can create liquidity traps or false signals.

Where fake BOS/C occur
- Fake BOS often shows up on lower time frames while the higher-timeframe structure remains intact.
- Important: Do not chase fake breaks seen on lower time frames as your primary entry signal. Use higher-timeframe structure for the main decision, and use lower time frames only for confirmatory entries.

Time frames and trading approach
- Time frame selection is relative and subjective. Examples:
  - Swing traders: daily to 4-hour charts as primary analysis frame; use lower frames (e.g., 1-hour, 30-minute) for entries.
  - Position traders: 4-hour to weekly or monthly frames.
- Do not mix too many frames when analyzing a single trade idea; focus on a primary frame (for the BOS/C) and use lower frames for confirmation only.
- Liquidity concept (for context)
  - Liquidity pools/traps often form around prior highs/lows or swing points. Price may pull back to “collect liquidity” before continuing the major move.

Recognizing and drawing fake BOS vs genuine BOS (uptrend example)
- Genuine uptrend progression
  - Higher highs and higher lows are formed on the main (higher) time frame.
  - A true BOS occurs when the price breaks the most recent higher high and continues the move upward.
- Fake BOS scenario on a lower time frame (illustrative)
  - On a lower time frame, you may see price move up a bit and appear to break a previous high, but the higher-time-frame structure has not actually violated its own high.
  - The price then reverses or moves sideways, indicating no real BOS on the higher time frame.
  - The takeaway: confirm breaks on the higher time frame before acting; avoid acting solely on a perceived break on a lower time frame.

Recognizing and drawing fake Change of Character (C)
- Proper Change of Character (C) in an uptrend
  - The market must first break the current high, then break the current low to confirm a shift in character.
  - After this, price may pull back to a POI (point of interest) or liquidity area and then move in the new direction.
- Fake Change of Character
  - The price moves up and tests highs or makes a new high but does not actually break the prior high (or does not adequately break the prior low in the sequence).
  - The move looks like a C, but the break structure is not real; price may recapture liquidity and continue the prior trend rather than shifting into a new phase.
  - If there is no real break of the prior high (for an uptrend) before a pullback, treat it as a potential liquidity grab rather than a genuine C.

Practical steps for trading with fake BOS/C awareness
- Identify the primary structure on your main time frame (e.g., daily for swing traders).
  - Mark higher highs and higher lows (uptrend) or lower highs and lower lows (downtrend).
- On a lower time frame, observe for potential fake signals but do not base entries solely on them.
  - Use the lower frame for a potential entry setup after confirming the higher-timeframe BOS/C.
- Look for a genuine BOS or C on the higher time frame first:
  - For uptrends: confirm that the highs are broken and the trend structure shifts accordingly.
  - For downtrends: confirm that the lows are broken and the trend structure shifts accordingly.
- When a C is suspected on the lower frame:
  - Check if the higher-timeframe high/low has actually been violated in the expected sequence.
  - A proper C should be supported by a break of the previous extreme on the higher timeframe.
- Use POI and liquidity concepts to plan exits and targets:
  - After a legitimate C, price may pull back to a POI and then continue.
  - Understand that liquidity pools can be targeted before continuation of the major move.

Entry and risk management guidance
- Entry approach:
  - Primary entry should be aligned with the higher-timeframe structure (BOS/C).
  - Use the lower timeframe to time entries, only after the higher-timeframe signal is in place.
- Stop loss placement:
  - Place stops beyond the last swing high (for longs) or swing low (for shorts) on the higher timeframe or the immediate liquidity trap area identified on the lower timeframe.
- Profit targets:
  - Use structure-based targets (next swing highs/lows, or a measured move from the BOS/C) or liquidity-based targets (POI).
- Avoid “peeking” into multiple frames too often; this can lead to misinterpretation of fake BOS/C.

Key terms to know
- Higher high / Higher low: price makes new highs and higher lows in an uptrend.
- Break of Structure (BOS): price breaks a significant swing line or previous extreme, signaling a potential continuation.
- Change of Character (C): a shift in market behavior, indicating a potential new phase; requires proper confirmation.
- Fake BOS: a false-looking break on a lower timeframe that does not reflect a true higher-timeframe BOS.
- Fake C (Change of Character): a misleading change in character that does not follow through with a true break of a prior extreme.
- Substructure: the price action on a lower timeframe that forms a structure within the higher timeframe’s structure.
- POI (Point of Interest): a price level or zone where price is expected to react (e.g., liquidity zones, prior highs/lows, order blocks).

Recommended practice
- Review and rewatch the tutorial to reinforce the concept of fake BOS and fake C.
- Practice identifying genuine vs fake BOS/C on multiple charts and timeframes.
- Focus on one main timeframe for structure, use lower timeframes for careful entry confirmation.
- Engage with the community (e.g., Telegram) for weekly calls and clarifications.

Note
