Here are flashcards based on the transcript. Each card has a question (Q) and answer (A).

1)
Q: What is the main topic of this tutorial?
A: Market structure 7, focusing on fake break of structure (BOS) and fake change of character (C).

2)
Q: What is a substructure?
A: The market structure on a lower time frame, a structure inside a higher time frame’s structure.

3)
Q: What is a real market structure in an uptrend?
A: Higher highs and higher lows.

4)
Q: What does BOS stand for?
A: Break of Structure.

5)
Q: What does C stand for in this context?
A: Change of Character.

6)
Q: Where do fake BOS and fake C occur?
A: On the substructure (lower time frame).

7)
Q: What is the recommended approach to time frames when analyzing structure?
A: Analyze the main trend on a higher time frame (e.g., 1 hour), and use lower time frames for confirmation and entry, not to redefine the main structure.

8)
Q: How should you treat a “fake BOS” on a lower time frame?
A: It appears as a small up-move on the lower time frame but is not a true break of the higher time frame structure.

9)
Q: What is liquidity in this context?
A: Areas where orders are accumulated (e.g., liquidity at swing highs/lows) that can cause pullbacks or reversals.

10)
Q: Why should you focus on the higher time frame for the main BOS?
A: Because fake BOSs often appear on lower time frames; the main, tradable break should be identified on the higher time frame.

11)
Q: What is the difference between a true change of character (C) and a fake C?
A: A true C occurs when the market breaks the high (in an uptrend) or the low (in a downtrend) and then moves, indicating a shift in structure. A fake C does not properly break the prior high (or low) before moving back, often leaving liquidity trapped.

12)
Q: What must happen for a proper change of character in an uptrend?
A: The market must first break the existing high, then come down to break the low (confirming a shift in the structure).

13)
Q: What indicates a fake change of character in an uptrend?
A: The market moves up and down without properly breaking the prior high, or it forms liquidity traps without a valid higher high break.

14)
Q: What is a liquidity trap in this context?
A: A setup where the market returns to collect liquidity before continuing in the original direction, often misleading as a BOS/C.

15)
Q: How should you validate entries when trading structure?
A: Use the higher time frame for the main BOS or C, then use lower time frames for confirmatory entries, not as the primary decision point.

16)
Q: What is a recommended practice for traders who swing trade?
A: Use the daily timeframe for swing trades and then go down to 4 hours or 1 hour for entry confirmation.

17)
Q: What is one potential risk when using very small time frames to identify BOS/C?
A: You may identify fake breaks that do not reflect the main trend, leading to premature or false entries.

18)
Q: What is the purpose of the “POI” in this context?
A: Point of Interest; a value area or liquidity point where price is expected to react, often used to identify potential changes or continuations.

19)
Q: How should you handle multiple time frame analysis to avoid confusion?
A: Decide on your main time frame for the structure (e.g., daily or 1H) and stick to it for BOS/C, using other time frames only for confirmation and entry, not for redefining the structure.

20)
Q: What resources are mentioned for staying informed and improving understanding?
A: The creator’s Telegram community for calls and weekly sessions, and watching the full video series in order.

21)
Q: What are the two main types of structure changes discussed?
A: Break of Structure (BOS) and Change of Character (C), including their fake variants on lower time frames.

22)
Q: How can you tell if a change of character is proper on an uptrend?
A: If the price breaks the previous high and then moves to break the next low in a way that confirms a shift in the trend, not just a liquidity dip.

23)
Q: How can you use liquidity concepts to your advantage?
A: Recognize where liquidity is being formed and expect pullbacks to those levels before continuing in the direction of the trend.

24)
Q: What is the final takeaway about fake BOS and fake C?
A: Understand their definitions, identify them on the correct time frame, and use higher-time-frame structure as the backbone with lower-time-frame confirmations to avoid false signals.
