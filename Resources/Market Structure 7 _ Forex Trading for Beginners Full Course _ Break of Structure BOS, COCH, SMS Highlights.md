- What the video covers
  - Market structure concepts: Break of Structure (BOS), Change of Character (CH/CC), and Shift of Market Structure (SMS).
  - How these concepts help gain an edge and stay profitable.
  - Practical examples on uptrends and downtrends, plus how to mark on charts.

- Key terminology on price action
  - Higher High (HH) and Higher Low (HL) indicate uptrends.
  - Lower Low (LL) and Lower High (LH) indicate downtrends.
  - Break of Structure (BOS): a break of the previous high (in an uptrend) or the previous low (in a downtrend).

- Break of Structure (BOS)
  - Definition: the price breaks the last high in an uptrend or the last low in a downtrend.
  - How to spot: identify the last high/low and mark a BOS where price breaks past it.
  - Visual: arrows/labels used to show BOS on chart (inside or on top, depending on preference).
  - Examples: BOS occurs both in uptrends (break of previous high) and in downtrends (break of previous low).

- Change of Character (CH/CC)
  - Definition: a move that changes the market from one trend direction to the opposite (uptrend to downtrend or downtrend to uptrend).
  - How to spot: after an uptrend, a retracement followed by sustained new direction downward marks a CH; similarly for the opposite.
  - Relationship to BOS: CH often follows a BOS and is accompanied by retracement/POI (points of interest) and liquidity areas.

- Shift of Market Structure (SMS)
  - Definition: a “weakness/continuation” signal indicating the market is shifting sentiment and preparing for a new trend direction.
  - Typical place: often occurs before a Change of Character.
  - How it looks: price behavior near higher highs (in uptrends) or lower lows (in downtrends) without breaking them, followed by a shift in direction.
  - Purpose: indicates early signs of a potential trend change, used in conjunction with CH and BOS.

- How to apply in analysis
  - Mark BOS in both uptrends and downtrends to identify breaks of prior highs/lows.
  - Look for CH after BOS as the trend direction changes (up to down or down to up).
  - Watch for SMS as an adjacent signal that the current structure may be weakening and a CH could follow.
  - Retracements often occur to value zones or liquidity areas after a CH, providing potential entry points.

- Practical tips from the video
  - You can annotate charts with BOS labels (BOS) and CH markers (CH/C) and optionally SMS.
  - Screenshots and additional visuals are provided in associated materials and on their X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram channels.
  - The concepts are foundational and recur across advanced topics in market structure.
