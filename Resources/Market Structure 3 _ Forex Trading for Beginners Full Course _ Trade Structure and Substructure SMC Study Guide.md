Study Guide: Market Structure and Substructure

Key concepts
- Market structure: The overall direction and framework of price movement on a higher time frame (HTF). It defines the main trend (uptrend, downtrend, or range) and major swings.
- Substructure: The smaller price movements within the main structure observed on a lower time frame (LTF). These are the pullbacks, retracements, and corrections inside the HTF trend.
- Higher time frame (HTF) vs lower time frame (LTF):
  - HTF shows the primary structure (e.g., daily time frame).
  - LTF reveals the substructure (e.g., 1-hour, 15-minute).
- Higher highs and higher lows describe an uptrend on the HTF: each swing high is higher than the previous high, and each swing low is higher than the previous low.
- Pullbacks and consolidations: Even within an uptrend on the HTF, the price may move down or sideways on the LTF before continuing higher.
- Time frame relationship: The HTF is used to identify the main trend; the LTF is used to observe the substructure and to look for entry opportunities (confirmations discussed in future videos).

Practical insights
- Structure vs substructure relationship:
  - Structure = the main market direction on the HTF (the larger swing series).
  - Substructure = the smaller price moves on the LTF that occur within the HTF structure.
- Entry considerations (mentioned as coming in a future video): Substructure can be used to find confirmation entries, but focus on the HTF structure first.
- Example frames:
  - 1) Daily time frame (HTF) + 1-hour time frame (LTF)
  - 2) 1-hour time frame (HTF) + 15-minute time frame (LTF)
  - Note: The higher time frame is the one that defines the main structure; the lower time frame shows substructure.
- Alternative time frames: You can use weekly/monthly/yearly as HTF and daily/4-hour as LTF, etc.

Chart observations (from the transcript)
- BTC/USD example on daily: Long-term uptrend with higher highs and higher lows.
- On the 1-hour time frame (within the daily uptrend): Price moves up, then pulls back (down move), then moves up again, showing substructure within the daily uptrend.
- Daily view can appear as a smooth up move, while the 1-hour view reveals the pullbacks and consolidation within that uptrend.

Assignment and practice
- Apply the concepts to EUR/USD:
  - Open EUR/USD chart.
  - Choose a HTF (e.g., daily) and identify the main structure (uptrend, downtrend, or range).
  - Switch to a lower time frame (e.g., 1-hour or 15-minute) and identify the substructure (pullbacks and local swings).
  - Compare what the HTF shows vs what the LTF shows to see how substructure appears inside the main structure.
- If you don’t use TradingView yet, set up a charting platform to practice identifying HTF structure and LTF substructure.

Practical setup tips
- Chart setup: Have two time frames visible (HTF and LTF) to compare structure and substructure.
- Time frame labeling: Note which time frame is HTF (higher) and which is LTF (lower) in any given pair.
- Real-time observation: Look for consistent higher highs and higher lows on HTF to define an uptrend, then observe corresponding pullbacks on LTF within that trend.

Upcoming topics mentioned
- Rally-based and drop-based price movements: How rallies and drops fit into market structure (to be covered in the next video).

What to remember
- Structure is the bigger picture on a higher time frame.
- Substructure is the smaller patterns within that bigger picture on a lower time frame.
- Use HTF to identify trend direction; use LTF to see pullbacks and potential entries (to be expanded in future lessons).

Suggested practice routine
- Pick a currency pair (e.g., EUR/USD or BTC/USD).
- On HTF (daily or 1-hour), identify the main trend and major swing highs/lows.
- Move to a lower time frame (1-hour or 15-minute) and map the substructure: where are the pullbacks, consolidations, and minor swings?
- Repeat across multiple market conditions (rising market, consolidating market, pulling back within a trend).

Notes
- This guide reflects the concepts as presented in the video: structure vs substructure, HTF vs LTF, and the example BTC/USD across daily and 1-hour time frames.
- Future videos will cover confirmation entries and rally-based vs drop-based movements in more detail.
