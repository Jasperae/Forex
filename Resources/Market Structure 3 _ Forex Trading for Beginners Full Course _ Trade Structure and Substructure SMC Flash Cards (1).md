- Q: What is the topic of the video?
  A: Market structure and substructure, and how time frames affect them.

- Q: In market structure, what is the "structure"?
  A: The higher-level movement of the market on a higher time frame (e.g., higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend).

- Q: In market structure, what is the "substructure"?
  A: The smaller movements within the main structure visible on a lower time frame (the local up/down moves inside the bigger trend).

- Q: What time frames are used in the example to explain structure and substructure?
  A: A higher time frame (daily) and a lower time frame (1 hour).

- Q: How is an uptrend defined in terms of price action?
  A: By a sequence of higher highs and higher lows.

- Q: True or false: Even inside an uptrend on a higher time frame, the lower time frame can show down moves.
  A: True. The lower time frame can have downtrends or pullbacks within the overall uptrend.

- Q: What does the presenter call the smaller trend observed on the lower time frame?
  A: The substructure.

- Q: How can you confirm the relationship between structure and substructure on different time frames?
  A: By comparing a higher time frame (structure) with a lower time frame (substructure) to see how the smaller moves fit into the bigger trend.

- Q: If the higher time frame used is 1 hour, what would be the lower time frame in the example?
  A: 15 minutes (15m).

- Q: If the higher time frame is daily, what are examples of lower time frames shown?
  A: 1 hour (1h) or 15 minutes (15m).

- Q: What tool is suggested for viewing and analyzing these time frames?
  A: TradingView (the charting platform).

- Q: How does the daily time frame typically appear compared to the 1-hour time frame, according to the example?
  A: The daily time frame may show a clear uptrend, whereas the 1-hour time frame shows more frequent pullbacks and consolidation within that uptrend.

- Q: What is the recommended charting exercise for understanding structure and substructure?
  A: Use BTC/USD or EUR/USD on TradingView, set a higher time frame (like daily or 1 hour) and a lower time frame (like 1 hour or 15 minutes), and compare the structure to the substructure.

- Q: What future topic is announced for the next video?
  A: Rally-based vs. drop-based moves.

- Q: What action does the presenter encourage at the end of the video?
  A: Subscribe, like, and share the video to help others learn.

- Q: What additional resource is mentioned for contact or support?
