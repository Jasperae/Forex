 Flashcards: Market Structure Basics

- Q: What is the main idea of market structure in this video?
  A: Markets move in stages (not just up or down) and go through accumulation, advancing (uptrend), distribution, and decline (downtrend).

- Q: What are the four basic stages of the market described?
  A: Accumulation, advancing, distribution, and decline.

- Q: What does accumulation mean in market structure?
  A: A consolidation phase that leads to a breakout to the upside.

- Q: What does advancing mean in market structure?
  A: A market moving in an uptrend (characterized by price rising).

- Q: What does distribution mean in market structure?
  A: A consolidation phase that leads to a breakout to the downside (often the topping phase before a move down).

- Q: What does decline mean in market structure?
  A: A downtrend (a move downward in price).

- Q: What is a reaccumulation?
  A: A second accumulation phase that occurs after an initial accumulation in an uptrend, where the market consolidates again before continuing upward.

- Q: What is redistribution in a downtrend context?
  A: A consolidation phase that occurs within a downtrend, often followed by further downward moves (the counterpart to redistribution in the uptrend).

- Q: How can you visually identify accumulation on a chart?
  A: A period of side-to-side or consolidation action followed by a breakout to the upside.

- Q: How can you visually identify distribution on a chart?
  A: A period of consolidation or sideways movement that precedes a move to the downside.

- Q: What is meant by “the market doesn’t just rally up or rally down”?
  A: It moves in stages with consolidations and trend phases (accumulation, advancing, distribution, decline).

- Q: What is the difference between accumulation and reaccumulation?
  A: Accumulation is the first consolidation leading to an upmove; reaccumulation is a subsequent consolidation within an uptrend that repeats the accumulation process.

- Q: What is the difference between distribution and redistribution?
  A: Distribution is the initial consolidation that leads to a down move; redistribution is the subsequent consolidation within a downtrend that repeats the distribution process.

- Q: In which stage would you expect a breakout to the upside?
  A: Accumulation (and potentially reaccumulation, if it occurs again in an uptrend).

- Q: In which stage would you expect a breakout to the downside?
  A: Distribution (and potentially redistribution, if it occurs again in a downtrend).

- Q: What is the practical use of understanding these stages for traders?
  A: To identify where the market is in its cycle and anticipate potential breakouts or breakdowns, aiding in entry/exit decisions.

- Q: What are the two terms that are sometimes used alongside the four stages to describe repeated patterns?
  A: Reaccumulation and Redistribution.

- Q: What is the next topic promised in the video series?
  A: Market structure two, covering demand and supply zone concepts.

- Q: What’s the overall takeaway from Market Structure 1?
