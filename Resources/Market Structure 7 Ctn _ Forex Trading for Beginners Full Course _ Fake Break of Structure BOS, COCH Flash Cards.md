- Card 1
  - Q: What is the overall topic of the tutorial?
  - A: Market structure 7 (breakdown with fake break of structure, fake BOS and fake C).

- Card 2
  - Q: What is a substructure?
  - A: The market structure on a lower time frame; a structure inside a higher time frame structure.

- Card 3
  - Q: What is the main market structure on an uptrend?
  - A: Higher highs and higher lows.

- Card 4
  - Q: Why is “fake BOS” called “fake”?
  - A: It appears as a break of structure on a lower time frame but is not the actual break on the higher time frame; it’s a false signal.

- Card 5
  - Q: On which timeframe do fake BOS and fake C typically occur?
  - A: On a lower time frame than the one you’re trading (the substructure).

- Card 6
  - Q: What should you do with time frames when analyzing structure?
  - A: Focus on one time frame for main analysis (e.g., 1-hour or daily) and use lower time frames only for confirmatory entries; avoid peeping across many time frames.

- Card 7
  - Q: How does a real break of structure happen on an uptrend?
  - A: A higher high is broken to the upside, followed by a pullback or continuation; this is the major break of structure.

- Card 8
  - Q: What is liquidity in the context of fake BOS/C?
  - A: Areas where orders accumulate (like liquidity pools) that can cause the price to pull back or retest before continuing.

- Card 9
  - Q: What is a false (fake) change of character?
  - A: A scenario where the price does not actually break the prior high (in an uptrend) or prior low (in a downtrend) but fakes the change of character, often to create liquidity traps.

- Card 10
  - Q: How can you identify a proper change of character on an uptrend?
  - A: The price must first break the previous high, then come down to break the low (creating a visible shift in market character).

- Card 11
  - Q: How can you identify a fake change of character?
  - A: The price moves up and down without actually breaking the prior high, or breaks the high and then doesn’t break the next low as expected, forming a liquidity trap.

- Card 12
  - Q: What is a “P.O.I.” in this context?
  - A: Point of Interest (a price area where liquidity may be absorbed or where you may consider entries).

- Card 13
  - Q: In an uptrend, what would a typical fake C look like on a lower time frame?
  - A: The market goes up, comes down to retest or approach the high but does not form a proper higher high; it may just create a liquidity sweep before continuing.

- Card 14
  - Q: In a downtrend, what would a proper change of character look like?
  - A: The price breaks a lower low, then breaks a lower high to confirm the shift, before continuing down.

- Card 15
  - Q: What is the recommended approach to trading a fake BOS or fake C?
  - A: Understand the concept on the higher time frame, confirm on a lower time frame, and avoid entering based solely on the fake signal; wait for the proper break on the main frame.

- Card 16
  - Q: What is the role of liquidity traps in this discussion?
  - A: They can cause price to reverse or revert to collect liquidity before continuing the main move; recognizing them helps avoid false entries.

- Card 17
  - Q: What is the difference between a real break of structure and a liquidity trap?
  - A: A real break of structure is a clear break of the prior high/low on the main timeframe, whereas a liquidity trap is a false move that forms liquidity without a genuine structural break.

- Card 18
  - Q: Why is it important to trade with the main break of structure on the higher time frame?
  - A: It reduces the likelihood of entering on false signals generated by fake BOS/C on lower time frames.

- Card 19
  - Q: What lesson is given about time frames regarding "swing" vs "scalping"?
  - A: Swing traders typically use daily to 4-hour time frames; scalpers may use shorter frames like 30 minutes to 1 hour; the key is to know your own time frame and not mix them up.

- Card 20
  - Q: What should you do after learning the concept in this video?
  - A: Revise the video, practice identifying real vs fake BOS/C, join the Telegram community for discussions and weekly calls, and continue to the next videos in the series.

- Card 21
  - Q: What is the recommended flow for analyzing structure in a trade setup?
  - A: Determine the larger trend and main break of structure on a higher time frame, then use lower time frames to find confirmatory entries, being mindful of potential fake signals on the substructure.
