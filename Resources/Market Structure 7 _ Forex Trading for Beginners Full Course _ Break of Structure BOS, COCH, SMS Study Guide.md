Study Guide: Market Structure, Break of Structure, Change of Character, and Shift of Market Structure

Purpose
- Learn the basic concepts to identify whoa points in price action that indicate changes in trend and continuation patterns.
- Terms to know: Break of Structure (BOS), Change of Character (COC or CC), Shift of Market Structure (SMS).
- Use these concepts to gain an edge in trading by recognizing structure changes and potential pullbacks or continuations.

Key Definitions
- Break of Structure (BOS)
  - A break of a previous high (in an uptrend) or a previous low (in a downtrend).
  - Signals that the current pattern may be weakening or a reversal/relocation of the trend could be starting.
  - In uptrends: break of the last swing high.
  - In downtrends: break of the last swing low.
- Change of Character (COC or CC)
  - A move that changes the market direction (trend) from up to down, or from down to up.
  - Often involves a break of the previous trend structure followed by a retracement and a new impulse in the opposite direction.
  - Indicates the market is transitioning to a new trend regime (e.g., from bullish to bearish, or vice versa).
- Shift of Market Structure (SMS)
  - A subtle form of structure shift indicating weakness and a continuation/shift in the trend.
  - Conceptually often occurs before a Change of Character.
  - SMS can be observed as a failure to push to a higher high (in an uptrend) or failure to push to a lower low (in a downtrend), signaling potential momentum shift toward the opposite direction.

Core Concepts and How to Identify Them on a Chart
- Price action basics
  - Uptrend is characterized by Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL).
  - Downtrend is characterized by Lower Low (LL) and Lower High (LH).
- Break of Structure (BOS) in an uptrend
  - Locate the last swing high.
  - When price closes below that high (or breaks below the previous swing low depending on the charting convention), mark BOS.
- Break of Structure (BOS) in a downtrend
  - Locate the last swing low.
  - When price closes above that low (or breaks above the previous swing high depending on convention), mark BOS.
- Change of Character (COC/CC)
  - After a BOS in the direction of a prior trend, price often retraces toward a significant area (POI, liquidity, value area) and then commits to a new direction.
  - Example: In an uptrend, a strong BOS followed by a retracement and a move below/through a critical high can signify a change to a downtrend.
  - In a downtrend, a BOS followed by retracement then a move above a critical low can signify a change to an uptrend.
- Shift of Market Structure (SMS)
  - Observed when the market structure begins to weaken in the current trend without an immediate complete reversal.
  - Example (uptrend): Price makes a new higher high but fails to push beyond and then retraces; sentiment shifts toward potential downside, indicating a shift in structure toward a possible reversal or deeper correction.
  - Example (downtrend): Price makes a new lower low but then retraces and fails to set a new lower low, indicating a potential shift toward an uptrend.

 Practical Guidelines and How to Mark on Charts
- In an Uptrend
  - Identify the last higher high (HH).
  - Look for BOS if price closes below that HH (i.e., breaks structure).
  - After BOS, watch for CHoC (Change of Character) signals: retracement to a value area or liquidity pool, then a move lower to indicate potential trend change.
  - If the price retraces and makes a new lower high and then breaks a previous high, you may see a change of character leading to a downtrend.
- In a Downtrend
  - Identify the last lower low (LL).
  - Look for BOS if price breaks above that LL (i.e., breaks structure).
  - After BOS, observe for CHoC: retracement to a local POI, then a move higher to indicate potential trend change to uptrend.
  - If price retraces and creates a higher high and then breaks below, you may see a change of character toward an uptrend.
- Where to place markers
  - You can place BOS markers at or inside the area where the break occurs. Some traders put the BOS label above the arrow; others place it inside the structure area. Consistency is key.
- Relation to liquidity/POI
  - CO C often involves retracement to liquidity zones, order blocks, or points of interest (POIs). These are common targets for the retracement before the next directional move.

 Simple Scenarios to Visualize
- Uptrend BOS and COC
  - Price forms HH and HL (uptrend).
  - Price makes a new HH and then breaks the previous HH (BOS).
  - Price retraces to a POI and then starts moving lower, indicating a possible CHoC and shift toward a downtrend.
- Downtrend BOS and COC
  - Price forms LL and LH (downtrend).
  - Price breaks above the previous LL (BOS in a downtrend context).
  - Price retraces to a POI and then starts moving higher, indicating a possible CHoC and shift toward an uptrend.
- SMS in both directions
  - SMS can appear as a subtle weakening signal before a CHoC; it often occurs before the actual change in trend and is used to anticipate a potential reversal.

Study Techniques
- Take screenshots or annotate charts to identify:
  - HH, HL, LH, LL levels.
  - The last swing high and swing low for BOS opportunities.
  - Points where CHoC/crossing of trend direction occurs.
  - Potential SMS warning signs (weakness before a clear break).
- Practice with both uptrend and downtrend charts:
  - Mark BOS occurrences.
  - Mark subsequent CHoC events and the resulting trend direction.
  - Note any SMS signals that preceded a CP (change of trend).
- Cross-reference with liquidity or POI zones to reinforce understanding of why retracements occur.

Practice Tasks
- Task 1: In an uptrend chart, identify the last swing high. Mark a BOS when price breaks that high. Then identify a potential Change of Character with a retracement and reversal pattern toward a downtrend.
- Task 2: In a downtrend chart, identify the last swing low. Mark a BOS when price breaks above that low. Then identify a potential Change of Character with a retracement and reversal pattern toward an uptrend.
- Task 3: Look for SMS signals in both directions. Note where price shows a subtle shift in structure before a clear BOS or CHoC occurs.

Note on Terminology and Notation
- The video uses various notations for CHoC (COC), e.g., CH, CC, or X; choose one consistent label in your own notes.
- SMS is explicitly “Shift of Market Structure” and is described as a precursor to a change of character in many cases.
- BOS (Breaker of Structure) is sometimes abbreviated as BOS or marked inside the structure area; pick one convention and stay consistent.

Summary of Takeaways
- Break of Structure (BOS) marks a key point where the current swing structure is violated (in uptrends: previous HH; in downtrends: previous LL).
- Change of Character (COC) indicates a decisive shift in trend direction (up to down, or down to up) after a significant move and retracement.
- Shift of Market Structure (SMS) signals a weakening of the current trend’s momentum and often precedes a Change of Character.
- Understanding and correctly identifying BOS, COC, and SMS helps you spot potential trend continuations and reversals more reliably.
- Practice by labeling HH/LH/HL/LL, BOS points, CHoC events, and SMS signals on real charts to build intuition.
