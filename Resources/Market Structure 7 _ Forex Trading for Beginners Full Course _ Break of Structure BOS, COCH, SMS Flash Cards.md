- Q: How would you describe an uptrend example in BOS terms?
  A: Price makes higher highs and higher lows; a BOS occurs when price breaks the last high, indicating a potential trend continuation or reversal depending on context.

- Q: How would you describe a downtrend example in BOS terms?
  A: Price makes lower lows and lower highs; a BOS occurs when price breaks the last low, indicating a potential trend continuation or reversal depending on context.

- Q: What is the practical way to mark a BOS on a chart?
  A: Use arrows to mark the break point at the previous high (uptrend) or previous low (downtrend) and label it BOS.

  A: It indicates the trend direction is changing, e.g., from up to down or from down to up, often with a retracement to a POI or liquidity area.

- Q: Can a change of character occur without a preceding clear BOS?
  A: It can, but a BOS often helps signal where the CoC might begin, as part of the transition.

- Q: What is the purpose of labeling BOS and CoC together in analysis?
  A: To identify where a trend may pause, reverse, or continue, aiding in entry/exit decisions.

- Q: What is the relationship between SMS and CoC?
  A: SMS indicates a shift in structure that often precedes or accompanies a change of character.

- Q: What should a trader pay attention to after a CoC occurs?
  A: A retracement to a block/value area or POI, which may provide a potential entry or liquidity target.
