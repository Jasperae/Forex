Study Guide: Premium and Discount Zones in Forex Trading

Key Concepts
- Premium Zone: The upper part of the price range (top of the rectangle). Treats as a more expensive price.
- Discount Zone: The lower part of the price range (bottom of the rectangle). Treats as a cheaper price.
- Relationship: Market structure often moves between premium (expensive) and discount (cheap) levels. Traders look for entries at discount zones and exits or sells at premium zones.

How to Identify Premium and Discount Zones
- Visual method: Draw a rectangle on a price chart.
- Split: Use the midpoint of the rectangle (50/50) to create two zones.
  - Top half = Premium Zone
  - Bottom half = Discount Zone
- Alternative methods: 50% retracement or Fibonacci levels can be used to mark the halfway line and define zones.

How to Think About Entries (Buy) and Exits (Sell)
- Buy (going long):
  - Aim to enter in the Discount Zone (lower part) and target or align exit (or take profit) in the Premium Zone (upper part).
  - Rationale: Buy cheaper in the discount zone, with the expectation that price will move up into the premium zone.
- Sell (going short):
  - Aim to enter in the Premium Zone (upper part) and target/exit in the Discount Zone (lower part).
  - Rationale: Sell higher in the premium zone, with the price expected to move down into the discount zone.

Practical Scenarios and Analogies
- Real-life analogy: Buying a product (e.g., iPhone 16)
  - Day 1: Pay a premium price (2 million) in the market.
  - Day 2: Bargain to a discount price (1.8 million). You get the cheaper price in the discount zone.
- Trading analogy: 
  - For a Buy: Enter near the discount zone, anticipate price to rise into the premium zone.
  - For a Sell: Enter near the premium zone, anticipate price to fall into the discount zone.
- Market behavior reminder:
  - Premium = expensive price level
  - Discount = cheaper price level
  - Market moves between these zones as it builds and retraces structure.

Example Walkthrough (Buy Example)
- Chart setup: Rectangle with top half = Premium Zone, bottom half = Discount Zone.
- Entry: Buy when price enters the Discount Zone.
- Target/exit: Take profit when price reaches or approaches the Premium Zone.

Example Walkthrough (Sell Example)
- Chart setup: Same Premium Zone (top) and Discount Zone (bottom).
- Entry: Sell (short) when price is in the Premium Zone.
- Target/exit: Cover or take profit in the Discount Zone.

Key Takeaways
- Premium Zone = top, expensive price level
- Discount Zone = bottom, cheaper price level
- For buys: look to enter in Discount Zone and move toward Premium Zone
- For sells: look to enter in Premium Zone and move toward Discount Zone
- Use chart tools (rectangle, 50/50 split, Fibonacci, etc.) to consistently identify zones
- Market structure often punishes staying long in discount zone without moving toward premium and vice versa
