- What consolidation is
  - Market moves sideways, i.e., a ranging or sideways market.
  - Price action forms a consolidation zone with potential breakouts in either direction (up or down).

- Why consolidation is tricky
  - You can’t predict the breakout direction with certainty; liquidity sits at key levels, making entries risky.
  - Retail traders often underestimate how much liquidity and orders are resting at support/resistance blocks.

- How consolidation can be traded
  - Some traders enter on breakouts (break of structure) or on pullbacks into consolidation zones (break and retest).
  - A long (buy) or short (sell) setup is possible depending on how price acts around the consolidation zone and liquidity nearby.

- Key concepts used with consolidation
  - Liquidity: visible as order blocks and resting buys/sells at certain zones; liquidity can drive price away once seized.
  - Break of Structure (BoS): a move that confirms a shift in market direction after a consolidation phase.
  - Market structure examples: uptrend (higher highs, higher lows) and downtrend (lower highs, lower lows) show how consolidation fits into the trend.

- Entry styles and risk management
  - Sniper entries: aiming to enter near liquidity blocks with a tight stop, but still allowing some space for movement.
  - Stop loss placement: keep some room (not too tight) due to liquidity and market noise.
  - Take profit targets: often aligned with the next major level or a defined structure (e.g., TP around 1:5 risk-reward, though results vary).

- Example scenarios
  - Uptrend with consolidation: price forms equal highs and equal lows, then may break up or down; a protective exit may be prudent if the market shows indecision.
  - Downtrend with consolidation: similarly, price can consolidate before continuing downward; traders may hold if confident but should consider exiting if the market proves indecisive.

- Decision points during consolidation
  - If in doubt or risk is high, consider closing the trade to protect capital.
  - If comfortable with risk and you understand liquidity dynamics, you can let the trade run toward the anticipated target.

- Practical tips from the video
  - Use blocks and liquidity zones to time entries.
  - Expect price to first test liquidity blocks before moving in the intended direction.
  - Balance discipline with back-tested strategies; some trades in consolidation can be highly profitable, others not.
