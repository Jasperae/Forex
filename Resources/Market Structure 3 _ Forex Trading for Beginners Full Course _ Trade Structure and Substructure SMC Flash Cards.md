- Q: What is the basic idea of market structure in this lesson?
  A: Market structure is the overall direction of the market on a higher time frame, with substructure showing the smaller movements on a lower time frame.

- Q: What are structure and substructure in simple terms?
  A: Structure is the main trend seen on a higher time frame; substructure is the smaller trends/movements visible on a lower time frame within that main trend.

- Q: Which time frames are used to explain structure and substructure in this video?
  A: A higher time frame (daily or 1-hour in the example) and a lower time frame (1-hour or 15-minute in the example).

- Q: In the example, what represents a higher high and a higher low?
  A: A higher high is a swing high that is higher than the previous swing high; a higher low is a swing low that is higher than the previous swing low.

- Q: What does the daily time frame show in the BTC example?
  A: The daily time frame shows an uptrend with higher highs and higher lows over time.

- Q: How does the lower time frame (e.g., 1 hour) relate to the higher time frame (e.g., daily) in this context?
  A: The lower time frame shows the substructure: the smaller up-down movements, pullbacks, and consolidations within the larger uptrend seen on the higher time frame.

- Q: Give an example of a substructure movement inside an uptrend.
  A: A move up, then a pullback (down), then another move up within the overall uptrend.

- Q: What is the typical focus for traders regarding structure and substructure?
  A: Traders usually focus on the structure (the higher time frame trend) and sometimes check the substructure on the lower time frame for confirmation.

- Q: What is the difference between structure on the higher time frame and substructure on the lower time frame?
  A: Structure shows the general direction of the market, while substructure shows the intermediate movements and pullbacks within that direction.

- Q: How can you tell which time frame is higher and which is lower in a given setup?
  A: The longer time frame (e.g., 1 hour, daily) is the higher time frame; the shorter time frame (e.g., 15 minutes) is the lower time frame.

- Q: In the example with 1 hour and 15 minutes, which is higher time frame and which is substructure?
  A: The 1 hour is the higher time frame (structure), and the 15 minutes is the lower time frame (substructure).

- Q: What other time frames are mentioned besides daily and 1 hour?
  A: Weekly, monthly, and yearly time frames.

- Q: How can you observe structure and substructure on BTCUSD using charts?
  A: By examining the daily time frame for the overall uptrend (structure) and then switching to a lower time frame like 1 hour to observe the substructure.

- Q: What did the video use to illustrate the difference between daily and hourly movements in BTC?
  A: The daily chart showed a clear uptrend with higher highs and higher lows, while the hourly chart showed up moves with pullbacks and consolidation inside that trend.

- Q: What is the suggested way to practice understanding structure and substructure?
  A: Look at different currency pairs (e.g., EURUSD) on the higher time frame first, then switch to a lower time frame within that same period to observe substructure.

- Q: What tool is repeatedly recommended for viewing charts and time frames?
