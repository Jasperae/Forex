## Study Guide: Break and Retest Strategy with Breaker Blocks (Based on Transcript)

### Core concepts
- Strategy type: Break and retest using breaker blocks (a breakout block concept from technical analysis).
- Entry approach: Enter on a break and retest setup, not necessarily at the initial breakout point. Uses a refined entry inside the breaker block.
- Confidence in entries: Some entries are missed due to refinement; not every setup will trigger an entry every time.
- Risk/reward targets: Typical plan mentioned includes a partial take at around 1R and full target at 6R (example from transcript). Exit strategy includes scaling and partials.
- Position sizing and risk: Example uses micro lots (0.01) with a small stop loss (e.g., $1) and a larger target (e.g., $6 profit) to illustrate risk management and psychological resilience.

### Trading framework described
- Timeframe and period: Analysis of a specific week around March 20-30; emphasis on weekly performance review.
- Entry rule details:
  - Identify a breaker block (previous breakout area).
  - Do not enter from the top of the breaker block.
  - Enter from a refined point inside the region; often involves entering about 10 pips in from the intended area.
  - Typical target and stop guidance: SL around 1R (small) and TP around 6R (larger).
  - Partial take profits is common (e.g., take 1R and leave the rest to run toward 6R).
- Sniper-like entries: The refinement can produce very tight, fast entries near the intended level.
- Missed entries: Market can “miss” entry points and continue; not all setups will present an entry opportunity.
- Mis-trade concept:
  - A mis-trade occurs when the price reaches the TP level without triggering the trader’s entry (e.g., occurring within the breaker block before the trader is entered).
  - If price reverses back after a mis-trade, you don’t re-enter immediately because it can retest and hit SL.
- Market psychology: The speaker emphasizes tolerance for missed trades and the importance of sticking to the plan; trading is not about predicting every move, but about consistency.

### Practice and validation
- Backtesting: A comprehensive backtest for March showed a mix of entries and misses, illustrating that the strategy isn’t 100% win-rate, but aims for consistency.
- Journal and accountability: The speaker uses a trading journal (YouTube trading journal) to document trades and progress, and invites others to join a community for shared learning.
- Realistic expectations: The speaker cautions that the strategy will have missed entries and that not all trades will hit perfectly; the goal is consistent profitability over time, not perfect frequency.

### Common terms and definitions
- Breaker block: A chart pattern or region indicating a breakout zone used to time entries on a retest.
- Break and retest: Price breaks a level and then returns to test the breakout level before continuing.
- Entry (refined entry): Entering slightly inside the region (e.g., 10 pips in) rather than exactly at the breakout point.
- SL (Stop Loss): The price level at which the trade is exited to prevent further loss; described as small (e.g., 1R).
- TP (Take Profit): The price level at which profits are taken; described as larger (e.g., 6R).
- 1R, 6R: Risk units; “R” is a measure of the trader’s risk per trade (distance from entry to SL). 6R indicates a six-times risk in profit potential.

### Step-by-step guide to applying the strategy (as described)
- Step 1: Identify breaker block on the chart in relation to the recent breakout area.
- Step 2: Plan the entry inside the region by refining the point of entry rather than entering exactly at the top of the breaker block.
- Step 3: Determine risk management:
  - Set a small stop loss (e.g., around 1R).
  - Plan for a larger take profit (e.g., 6R).
  - Consider partial entries (e.g., take 1R and let the remainder run to TP).
- Step 4: Enter with precision (e.g., enter 10 pips inside the region).
- Step 5: Monitor for miss events:
  - If price misses the entry and continues to TP or beyond, label it as a mis-trade.
  - Do not re-enter immediately if price reverses, to avoid being knocked out again.
- Step 6: Review weekly performance:
  - Acknowledge missed entries and mis-trades.
  - Focus on consistency and risk management rather than winning every trade.
- Step 7: Journal and reflect:
  - Document entries, misses, MIS trades, SL triggers, and TP hits.
  - Use the journal to improve technique and adherence to the plan.
- Step 8: Community and learning:
  - If desired, join a trading community or Telegram group for ongoing updates and shared learning.

### Key takeaways
- The break and retest strategy with breaker blocks can produce high-probability setups but will include missed entries and occasional mis-trades.
- Precision entry within the breaker block region and tight stop losses help create “sniper-like” entries.
- Always manage risk with small SLs and consider partial profits to secure some gain while allowing the rest to run.
- Backtesting and journaling are essential to confirm strategy viability and to track progress.
- Stay consistent, patient, and accept that no strategy yields a 100% win rate.

### Possible study questions
- What is a breaker block, and how does it influence entry timing in this strategy?
- Why might an entry be missed even when a breakout occurs?
- What does the concept of a mis-trade refer to, and how should a trader respond?
- How are 1R and 6R used in the described strategy, and why might partials be useful?
- How can backtesting and journaling improve performance with this approach?

### If you want to practice with the same approach
- Follow the described steps in a demo or controlled live environment.
- Use a small risk per trade (e.g., 0.01 lots) to keep psychological pressure manageable.
- Document every trade, including misses and mis-trades, to identify patterns and improve discipline.
- Consider joining the trading community or Telegram group mentioned to share insights and get feedback.
