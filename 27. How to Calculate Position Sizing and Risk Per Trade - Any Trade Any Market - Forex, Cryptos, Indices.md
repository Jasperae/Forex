## Study Guide: Position Sizing and Risk Management for Trading

### Key ideas
- Position sizing determines how much of the asset you buy or sell based on your risk.
- The goal is to risk a small, predefined percentage of your trading capital per trade while aiming for a higher potential reward.
- Use precise entry, stop loss (SL), and take profit (TP) levels to calculate the exact position size.
- Margin mode (isolated vs. cross) and leverage affect how much you can lose on a trade; isolated margin limits risk to the chosen amount.

### Core concepts explained in the video
- Entry setup: Identify a valid setup (structure break, liquidity targets, etc.). Mark entry, TP zones, and SL beneath/above the relevant block.
- Risk per trade: Decide how much of your account you are willing to risk (e.g., $2 on a $100 account, or a fixed percentage like 2%).
- Position size (quantity): The amount of the asset you buy or sell, determined by how much you are willing to lose and how much you’ll lose per unit move.
- Leverage: A levered position amplifies both risk and reward. Proper calculation helps you know exactly how much you’re risking in dollar terms.

### How to calculate position sizing (step-by-step)
1) Determine your risk amount per trade
   - Example: On a $100 account, you want to risk 2% per trade.
   - Risk amount = account size × risk percentage
   - Example: $100 × 2% = $2 risk per trade

2) Identify entry (price) and stop loss distance
   - Entry price (price you plan to enter)
   - Stop loss price (price at which your trade will be exited if it goes against you)
   - Distance to SL in dollar terms per unit (how much you are willing to lose per unit of the asset)

3) Compute risk per unit of the asset
   - Risk per unit = entry price − stop loss price (for long) or stop loss − entry (for short), expressed in dollars per unit of the asset
   - This tells you how much money you lose per unit if the stop is hit

4) Compute position size (quantity)
   - Quantity = risk amount / risk per unit
   - If your risk per unit is $2 and you want to risk $2 total, your maximum quantity is 1 unit
   - In practice, you’ll often get fractional quantities (e.g., 0.037 BTC or 0.915 ETH, etc.)

5) Apply margin and leverage considerations
   - Isolated margin vs. cross margin:
     - Isolated margin: risk is limited to the amount you allocate to that specific position.
     - Cross margin: your entire account balance can be used to support your positions.
   - Set margin type to isolated if you want to cap risk to a small amount.
   - Leverage: If using 10x leverage, your required marginal capital is smaller, but your risk per trade remains tied to the actual stop loss distance and position size.

6) Verify the risk-reward
   - Potential loss if SL is hit: risk amount (as defined)
   - Potential gain if TP is hit: position size × price move to TP
   - Ensure the risk-reward ratio aligns with your trading plan (e.g., at least 1:2 or better)

### Practical example (based on the transcript)
- Account size: $100
- Risk per trade: 2% → $2 total risk
- Entry and SL: Long setup; SL is below the entry price at a specified distance (example distance in dollars per unit)
- Quantities shown in the transcript:
  - Initial read: quantity 0.915 (example for ETH/USDT on Bybit)
  - Adjusted to fit $2 risk on $100 account results in 0.037 quantity (final position size)
- TP distance: Example TP target around 4,863.9 (in dollars per ETH)
- Stop loss distance: Example stop loss around 3,770.13 (in dollars per ETH)
- Resulting risk per trade: about 1.43% of the asset’s price move (in the transcript)
- Resulting reward: around 6.84% if TP is hit
- Leverage calculation (illustrative): 
  - If risk per trade is 1.43% of the asset price, you can estimate leverage with a formula like: leverage ≈ account size / (risk percentage × account size)
  - In the video, a calculation was shown (e.g., 100 ÷ 1.43 ≈ 69.9) as a rough guide to the needed leverage, but the exact placement depends on your risk amount and the dollar distance of SL. Use this as a rough check, not a fixed rule.

### Important trading mechanics shown
- Limiting orders vs market orders:
  - The example uses limit orders to control execution price.
- Margin types:
  - Isolated margin enables controlling the exact amount you’re risking on that trade.
- Platform behavior:
  - Bybit is used in the example; the same principles apply across exchanges (Binance, Bitget, etc.).
  - Ensure you convert the quantity to the correct unit for the asset you are trading (e.g., BTC, ETH, or contract quantity on futures).

### What you should practice
- Define your own risk percentage per trade (e.g., 1–3%).
- For a hypothetical trade, calculate:
  - Risk amount (account size × risk%)
  - Risk per unit (SL distance in dollars)
  - Quantity (risk amount ÷ risk per unit)
  - Adjust margin type to isolated if you want to cap risk to the set amount
- Check the risk-reward ratio before placing the trade (aim for a favorable ratio, like 1:2 or better).
- Practice placing limit orders and setting stop loss and take profit levels on a test account or in a simulation.

### Common pitfalls to avoid
- Don’t ignore risk percentage; you may be risking too much per trade.
- Don’t rely on crude lot sizes without calculating exact quantity based on risk.
- Avoid using cross margin if you want to prevent your entire account from being wiped out on a single loss.
- Be mindful that leverage magnifies both profit and loss; calculate leverage correctly for each trade to know your true risk.

### Quick reference checklist before placing a trade
- [ ] Determine account size and risk per trade (percentage or dollar amount)
- [ ] Define entry, SL, and TP precisely
- [ ] Calculate risk per unit (distance from entry to SL in dollars)
- [ ] Compute position size (quantity = risk amount / risk per unit)
- [ ] Choose margin type (isolated) if you want strict risk control
- [ ] Set leverage at a level you’re comfortable with and confirm on the platform
- [ ] Place a limit order if you want a specific entry price
- [ ] Confirm TP and SL placements and review the risk-reward
- [ ] Monitor the trade and adjust only if your plan requires it

### Study/activity questions
- If you have a $200 account and you want to risk 2% per trade, what is your dollar risk per trade?
- If your entry is 4,000, your SL is 3,900, and you want to risk $2 per trade, what is your maximum position size (quantity)?
- How does isolating margin change your maximum loss on a single trade compared to cross margin?
- Why is it important to calculate the risk per unit distance (in dollars) rather than just the percentage?
