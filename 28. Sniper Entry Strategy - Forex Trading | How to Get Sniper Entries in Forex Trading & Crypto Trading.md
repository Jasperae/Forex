## Study Guide: Trading with Sniper Entries (Gun 2 method)

### Purpose
- Learn how to use sniper entries to enter trades at optimal price levels.
- Understand advantages, risks, and when to use or avoid sniper entries.
- See practical examples with levels, stops, targets, and risk management.

### Key Concepts
- Sniper Entry: A precise entry you aim for at a specific low-risk zone (usually a 50% point of a chosen block/zone) to improve entry quality.
- Gun 2 (G2): A trading tool/setting used to generate or refine sniper entries. It helps you buy at the “cheapest” part of a block/zone and can increase potential reward if entry timing is right.
- Other Block: The primary price level or block from which you normally enter a trade.
- 50% Zone: The halfway point of the chosen block/zone, often used as the Sniper Entry area for cheaper pricing and better reward-to-risk.
- Premium/Discount Levels: Concepts discussed earlier (not fully explained here) about identifying the cheapest parts of a block to enter.

### Setup and Tools
- Platform: Demonstrated on a chart (example pair: AAX/USD).
- Gun 2 settings: Optimized per trader’s taste; common reference mentions using 0, 0.5, and 1 (can be adjusted). Example: someone may share their own settings in a Telegram group.
- How to apply Gun 2:
  - Draw the Gun 2 to cover the “Other Block” (the price range you want to target for entries).
  - Enter from the extreme price area or from the 50% Zone (50% of the cheapest part of the block) for sniper entries.
  - The Gun 2 can be used to add an extra entry after you already have a position from the Other Block.

### Entry Rules and Targets
- Primary entry (Other Block): Enter at a predefined level based on your normal setup (not necessarily sniper). This is your base position.
- Sniper entry (Gun 2): Enter at the 50%/cheapest portion of the block if price dips into that zone.
- Entry location considerations:
  - If price moves from the top, you might enter higher; sniper entries often come from the cheaper half of the block.
  - Entering from the 50% Zone is about catching a favorable pullback/discount so the risk-to-reward improves.
- Stops (SL) and Take Profits (TP):
  - Stop loss levels should align with the risk of the entry zone (e.g., similar stop to the base entry or slightly adjusted for the Sniper entry).
  - Take profit targets can be multiple (TP1, TP2, etc.). Example in the transcript describes aiming for top of the block or a higher target depending on setup.

### Risk Management and Trade Sizing
- Combine entries to control risk:
  - Example: Risk 1% on the base entry (Other Block) and risk 0.5% on the Gun 2 sniper entry.
  - Total risk per trade idea around 1.5% for dual-entry scenarios.
  Potential outcomes:
  - If only the base entry hits TP (e.g., 5.0+R), you gain ~5%+ depending on how it scales.
  - If only the sniper entry hits, you might gain a similar gain depending on the distance (e.g., 4–5%+).
  - If neither hits, you may lose the combined risk (e.g., 1.5%).
- Testing and psychology:
  - Consider backtesting or simulated trades to see how sniper entries affect overall profitability.
  - Understand that waiting for sniper entries can cause you to miss some trades if the market doesn’t pull back to the 50% Zone.
  - Use two accounts for testing: one with standard entries and one using Gun 2 sniper entries to compare performance.

### Trade Scenarios and Examples (Conceptual)
- Example A: Buying from Other Block vs. Gun 2 sniper
  - Enter base trade from the Other Block (earlier price level).
  - Use Gun 2 to place an additional sniper entry at the 50% Zone of the block.
  - If price moves to the 50% Zone and triggers Gun 2, add additional exposure with smaller risk (e.g., 0.5%).
  - Combined exposure aimed to achieve a higher yield, but carries risk if price doesn't move as expected.

- Example B: Inducement and Liquidity
  - Inducement levels and liquidity sweeps can cause price movement to clear liquidity before continuing in your target direction.
  - Gun 2 sniper entry can help capture a position if the market returns to the cheaper zone after an inducement move.

- Example C: Missed sniper entry
  - If price never revisits the 50% Zone, the sniper entry won’t trigger.
  - You may still have your base entry; you would not take the Gun 2 entry in this case.
  - If the Gun 2 entry triggers later, you may have already moved to break-even levels or different profit targets; some traders may skip it if it’s liquidated away.

### Practical Tips
- Always enter from the cheapest part of the block when aiming for sniper entries.
- Use the 50% Zone to improve probability and risk/return ratio.
- Use Gun 2 in conjunction with or after you have a position from the Other Block (avoid over-leveraging if you’re new).
- Keep an eye on stop loss placements to avoid excessive drawdown.
- If you’re learning, run a dual-account test:
  - Account A: Standard entry strategy (Other Block).
  - Account B: Sniper entries (Gun 2) used as an additional layer.
  - Compare results and psychology across multiple trades.

### Cautions and Considerations
- Sniper entries can cause you to miss trades if the market doesn’t visit the 50% Zone.
- The Gun 2 approach requires careful risk management; you can overexpose if not careful.
- Psychological factors may cause you to hold through reversals to chase TP; set realistic expectations and use break-even or partial TP strategies if needed.

### Actionable Checklist (Before Trading)
- Define your base entry: Where do you enter from the Other Block?
- Mark the block/zone and identify the 50% Zone for sniper entry.
- Configure Gun 2 settings (start with recommended values like 0, 0.5, 1; adjust to your taste).
- Decide risk per trade (e.g., 1% base, 0.5% sniper).
- Determine SL and TP levels for both lines of entry.
- Prepare a backtest or paper-trade plan to compare performance.
- Subscribe to updates from the training source and review additional material on premium/discount levels if relevant.

### Key Takeaways
- Sniper entries aim to improve entry quality by targeting the cheaper half of a price block.
- Gun 2 is a tool to add sniper entries, ideally after a base position is already considered or placed.
- Proper risk management, disciplined entry rules, and testing are essential to successful use of sniper entries.
- Practice with two accounts and backtest to understand how sniper entries affect profitability and psychology.
