### Study Guide: Market Structure (Video from the series)

### Core idea
- The market moves in stages, not just up or down. Understanding the four stages helps identify potential breakouts and trends.

### The four stages of the market
- Accumulation
  - Definition: A consolidation phase where price moves sideways after a downturn, leading to a breakout to the upside.
  - Key idea: Buyers are accumulating positions, preparing for the next up move.
- Advancing (Advancement)
  - Definition: A rising price action or uptrend following accumulation; the market is moving higher.
  - Key idea: The market is in an uptrend during this stage.
- Distribution
  - Definition: A consolidation phase where price moves sideways after an up move, leading to a breakout to the downside.
  - Key idea: Sellers are distributing positions, preparing for the next down move.
- Decline (Decline/Downtrend)
  - Definition: A downward price action; the market is in a downtrend.
  - Key idea: The market moves lower during this stage.

### Additional concepts and terminology
- Reaccumulation
  - Definition: A subsequent accumulation phase that occurs after an initial up move (second accumulation in an uptrend).
  - Note: It’s still part of the accumulation framework, just a repeated cycle in the same trend direction.
- Redistribution
  - Definition: A subsequent distribution phase that occurs after an initial down move (second distribution in a downtrend).
  - Note: It’s a repeated consolidation in the direction opposite to the current trend within the same overall cycle.
- Consolidation
  - Broad concept: Periods where price moves sideways or within a range, often signaling accumulation or distribution phases.

### How to identify on a chart
- Accumulation often appears as a consolidation range following a decline, followed by a breakout to the upside.
- Advancing is visible as an uptrend after accumulation.
- Distribution appears as a consolidation range after an uptrend, followed by a breakout to the downside.
- Decline appears as a downtrend after distribution or redistribution.
- Reaccumulation shows a new accumulation phase occurring after an initial rise within an uptrend.
- Redistribution shows a new distribution phase occurring after an initial drop within a downtrend.

### Diagram interpretation (described verbally)
- Visualize a price chart with color-coded zones:
  - Accumulation zone: sideways movement with breakout to the upside.
  - Advancing zone: upward slope (uptrend).
  - Distribution zone: sideways movement with breakout to the downside.
  - Decline zone: downward slope (downtrend).
  - Reaccumulation: another accumulation zone within or after an uptrend.
  - Redistribution: another redistribution zone within or after a downtrend.

### Practical takeaways for trading
- Markets move in cycles: look for consolidation zones that precede breakouts (accumulation or redistribution).
- Use the stage context to anticipate potential breakouts:
  - Breakout from accumulation → potential buy/setup (upward move).
  - Breakout from distribution → potential sell/setup (downward move).
- Recognize reaccumulation and redistribution as repeats of the same stage in the overall trend.
- Combine structure with other tools (e.g., price action, volume) to confirm the phase.

### Key terms recap
- Accumulation: consolidation leading to upside breakout.
- Advancing: the uptrend phase.
- Distribution: consolidation leading to downside breakout.
- Decline: the downtrend phase.
- Reaccumulation: a second accumulation phase within an uptrend.
- Redistribution: a second distribution phase within a downtrend.
- Consolidation: general sideways movement between phases.

### Study questions
- What signals indicate the market is entering an accumulation phase?
- How would you differentiate an accumulation phase from a redistribution phase on a chart?
- What is the difference between an advancing stage and a redistribution stage?
- How can reaccumulation affect your trading decisions within an uptrend?

### Next steps (in the series)
- Market Structure 2: Focus on Demand and Supply Zone concepts.
- Practice: Review price charts and label the four stages (and any reaccumulation/redistribution) based on recent price action.
