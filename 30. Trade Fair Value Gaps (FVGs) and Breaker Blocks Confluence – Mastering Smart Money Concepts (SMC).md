## Study Guide: BTC/USD Backtest and Trade Setup

### Purpose of the video
- Learn a specific intraday trading setup focused on BTC/USD (also applicable to other major FX pairs and crypto pairs).
- Emphasis on backtesting a defined strategy to identify high-probability entries with clear confirmation.

### Key concepts and terminology
- Fair Value Gap (FVG)
  - A price gap created by impulsive market moves that leaves imbalanced orders.
  - Often identified in higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour) and used as a region where price may return to collect liquidity.
  - The FVG region is used as an inducement zone for higher prices or lower prices, depending on the setup.
- Inducement
  - A region where price activity suggests liquidity will be taken from, often just beyond or inside the FVG.
  - Used to increase confidence in entry timing (a price move to “pull” liquidity before continuing in the intended direction).
- Breaker Block / Block
  - A previous price level that formed a liquidity imbalance; after an impulsive move, price retests this zone.
  - The idea is to look for a break of a local structure and a retest to confirm a continuation setup.
- Higher Timeframe (Timeframe context)
  - The strategy emphasizes looking at higher timeframe concepts (e.g., 1-hour) to locate the FVG and breaker blocks, then enter on intraday moves.
- Fibonacci Retracement (FIB)
  - Use 0.618 to 0.786 as entry refinement zones in a retracement after a move to the inducement area and FVG region.
  - The newer setting focuses on avoiding very long-value trades; prefer short intraday moves that can complete within the day.
- Entry Zone vs. Entry Trigger
  - Entry zones are defined regions (FVG, breaker block, inducement, and Fibonacci retracement levels) from which a price move may start.
  - Entry triggers are precise actions (e.g., price entering a region and then giving a confirmatory touch to a Fibonacci level).

### Trade setup (core steps)
1. Identify the setup location
   - Find a fair value gap (FVG) on the chart (preferably in a higher timeframe such as 1-hour).
   - Confirm there was a breaker block/impulsive move followed by a CLE (clear liquidity event) that shows price willingness to retest.
2. Confirm inducement region
   - Determine the inducement area around the FVG where price is likely to pull liquidity before resuming the move.
   - The entry zone is typically around or inside the FVG region or the immediate neighboring block.
3. Apply Fibonacci retracement for confirmation
   - Draw Fibonacci from the recent high to the recent confirmed low near the FVG/inducement area.
   - The preferred entry is around 0.618–0.786 retracement (not the more aggressive 0.50–0.61 unless you have additional confirmation).
4. Determine the exact entry point
   - Use a combination of FVG, inducement, and the 50% level of the Fibonacci retracement for the entry price.
   - The goal is to place the order in a zone that aligns with all confirmations (FVG, inducement, and Fibonacci confluence).
5. Define stop loss and risk management
   - The strategy mentions a risk/reward approach that allows for a few losses without breaking even, implying a disciplined risk cap per trade.
   - Examples suggest a structure such as “one setup per account with a defined risk; you can lose several times but still stay profitable.”
6. Determine take profit (TP) placements
   - Use multiple TP zones: partial take profits at intermediate Fibonacci levels (e.g., 0.382, 0.5, 0.618) and a final target (e.g., 0.236 of retracement or another logical resistance/support zone).
   - It’s acceptable to take partial profits at 0.5 or 0.382 and let the remainder run to the final TP if price action supports it.
7. Manage the trade during a favorable move
   - Look for a change of character (an indication of a trend or momentum shift) as additional confirmation.
   - If price breaks the entry region with strong momentum, you may adjust or trail; otherwise, exit at your TP levels.

### Entry criteria checklist (for quick reference)
- FVG present in or around the entry area
- Breaker block / adjacent order liquidity confirmed
- Inducement zone identified and price shows acceptance into/through it
- Fibonacci retracement applied from the most relevant swing high to swing low
- Entry aligned with 50% level of Fibonacci and FVG region
- Confluence among FVG, inducement, and Fibonacci on the same side (short entry in a downward move, long entry in an upward move)
- Clear plan for stop loss, partial TP, and final TP

### Risk and position management notes
- One account, one setup concept: maintain a consistent risk framework per trade.
- The model allows for multiple losing trades before reaching break-even due to the designed risk tolerance (as described: “you can go ahead to lose five times and still be break even” in the example).
- Prefer intraday moves that complete within the day; avoid very long trades unless more confirmation is present.
- Use strict stop loss placement around the entry region to protect against false signals.

### Trading workflow for backtesting
- Start with a clean chart and mark FVGs and breaker blocks on the chosen pair (BTC/USD or others).
- Identify inducement zones around the FVGs using price structure and order flow logic.
- Apply Fibonacci retracement from the relevant swing high to the swing low; confirm entry near 0.618–0.786.
- Verify confluence of all three elements (FVG, inducement, Fibonacci) before taking a trade.
- Enter in the defined zone, place stop loss just beyond the immediate opposing edge of the entry area, and set TP targets with partials as described.
- Track outcomes to assess consistency; aim to replicate the same setup pattern across multiple trades.

### Notes on interpretation and learning
- The strategy relies on probabilistic outcomes, not guaranteed outcomes. Phrases like “probability” and “not 100% guaranteed” appear to remind that no setup is flawless.
- A backtest video will be released to illustrate the process from start to finish; use that as a reference for applying the criteria.

### What to practice next
- Watch the BOS and C video (full price action/technical analysis playlist) to strengthen understanding of structure, FVGs, and breaker blocks.
- Review the provided template or visuals in the described Telegram group to see the exact setup in picture form.
- If anything isn’t clear, leave a comment to get clarification or request a concrete example.

### Optional guidance
- If you want a more sniper entry, incorporate all confirmations (FVG, inducement, and Fibonacci) and place entries slightly above the immediate counter block, ensuring there is enough buffer to avoid a false breakout.
- Use multiple TP levels to capture profit while allowing the remainder to run if momentum continues.

### What you should be able to do after studying
- Identify FVGs and breaker blocks on BTC/USD (and similar pairs) and understand how inducement fits into the setup.
- Apply a refined Fibonacci retracement strategy to enter within a confluence zone.
- Execute a disciplined intraday trade with predefined stop loss and partial/final take profit levels.
- Backtest the approach consistently to verify profitability and refine risk management.
