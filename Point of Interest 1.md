## Study Guide: Point of Interest - Other Blocks (SMC)

### Overview
- Topic: Understanding and using other blocks as a Point of Interest (POI) in market structure and Smart Money Concepts (SMC).
- Purpose: Identify where the market may reverse or continue, and plan entry, stop loss, and take profit accordingly.
- Tools mentioned: Chart drawing tools (rectangle), measurement tools (long/short position or distance), color customization for clarity.

### Key Concepts and Definitions
- Point of Interest (POI): Specific areas or zones in the market where price may reverse, offering potential entries, take profit, or stops.
- Other Block: A type of POI in SMC. It’s a block that has order flow behind it (ERS) and often represents where order flow is stored before a move. It can be bullish or bearish.
  - Bullish Other Block: Contains buy orders; it tends to sponsor a move to the upside.
  - Bearish Other Block: Contains sell orders; it tends to sponsor a move to the downside.
- Order Block (context): The source of order flow; related to where orders are located and where price may react.
- Left Behind: An other block is usually left behind after a break of structure (BOS). It serves as a target for liquidity and potential entry.
- Source Candle: The candle that defines the origin of the other block.
  - For a bullish move, the source candle is bearish (typical in a bullish context).
  - For a bearish move, the source candle is bullish (typical in a bearish context).
- Liquidity Clearing Candle: A candle that clears liquidity around a region; used to justify drawing an other block that accounts for liquidity around the area.
- Weeks (Wick): Some blocks are drawn to include or exclude weeks (shadows) depending on whether you’re capturing full block or liquidity extent.
- Golfing Candle: A strong signal candle pattern that can confirm a POI (mentioned as a pattern to watch for in context of other blocks).

### How to Identify and Draw Other Blocks
- Step 1: Identify the Source Candle
  - Bullish scenario: Source candle is a bearish candle that precedes an upside move (the bullish order block context).
  - Bearish scenario: Source candle is a bullish candle that precedes a downside move (the bearish order block context).
- Step 2: Determine the Block Extent
  - For a straightforward block, draw from the top of the source candle to the bottom (basic rectangle).
  - If there is a liquidity event (weeks/wicks clearing liquidity), extend the block to include the liquidity-clearing candle’s range.
- Step 3: Draw the Rectangle (Block)
  - Use a rectangle tool on your chart.
  - For a bullish other block: draw from the top to bottom of the range that defines where orders sit.
  - For a bearish other block: draw similarly around the corresponding range on the downside.
  - If there are weeks/wicks you want to include (case 2/4 scenarios), draw the rectangle from the start of the block to the relevant week/low/high to cover liquidity.
- Step 4: Color and Label
  - Use distinct colors to differentiate Bullish vs Bearish blocks.
  - Example: Customize colors to your preference (e.g., blue/purple tones) for easy recognition.
- Step 5: Pattern Recognition
  - Look for golfing (strong bullish or bearish candles) around the POI as confirmation.
  - Consider that an other block can appear as a conventional bullish/bearish candle or as a complex pattern with strong implied order flow.

### Case Scenarios for Drawing and Using Other Blocks
- Case 1: Basic draw from source candle to block extent
  - Draw the rectangle from the source candle to capture the block area that will potentially hold orders.
- Case 2: Block with a wick (weekly) extending to wick
  - Extend the block to include the wick that clears liquidity; this creates a broader POI that accounts for liquidity around the region.
- Case 3: (Mentioned as case 3 in video) Another variation (not detailed); concept remains: adjust block extent to capture key liquidity zones.
- Case 4: Another variation with a weak or partial wick
  - Similar extension logic, ensure the block captures the relevant liquidity area.

### Trading Setup: How to Use Other Blocks for Entries
- Buy Setup (in bullish context):
  - Expect price to come back to the bullish other block.
  - Entry: Open a long position with the buy level aligned to the other block’s area.
  - Stop Loss: Place below the block (beneath the lower boundary of the other block).
  - Take Profit: Target a resistance/uptick, or multiple targets (e.g., 1.3x, 1.5x, etc. depending on risk preference and liquidity structure).
  - R/R concept: The reward-to-risk ratio is explained conceptually (e.g., aiming for targets around 1:3 or 1:5 depending on setup and liquidity).
- Sell Setup (in bearish context):
  - Expect price to come back to the bearish other block (above it in some configurations; depends on time-frame and market structure).
  - Entry: Open a short position at the POI.
  - Stop Loss: Place above the block (above its upper boundary).
  - Take Profit: Target below the block, often at the next liquidity level or next major support zone.
- Positioning and Levels:
  - Use a measurement tool to set long/short entry levels and to calculate distance to targets.
  - Ensure the position size and risk are aligned with your strategy and capital.
  - Understanding AR (Reward to Risk) concepts: Risk one unit to gain multiple units (e.g., risk 1 to gain 5), which emphasizes large potential rewards with favorable R/R if accuracy is sufficient.

### Practical Tips
- Always relate POIs to the order flow concept: blocks exist to house future market orders (ERS) that drive price movement.
- Combine with other indicators/patterns:
  - Golfing candles as a strong confirmation signal around the POI.
  - Look for breaks of structure (BOS) to justify the relevance of a left-behind other block.
  - Consider liquidity and consolidation context around the POI.
- Use custom chart settings to improve readability:
  - Color-code blocks (bullish vs bearish) for quick recognition.
  - Use consistent block drawing rules (top-to-bottom or based on liquidity).
- Practice and assignment:
  - Practice identifying multiple other blocks on charts and share results for feedback.
  - Review videos in the playlist for broader context on market structure and other SMC concepts.

### Common Terms to Know
- BOS (Break of Structure): A price move that creates a new market structure, often leading to the left-behind order blocks and potential POIs.
- Liquidity Clearing Candle: A candle that "clears" liquidity in the area, often triggering a larger move and creating a POI for the next leg.
- ERS (Order Flow): The presence of orders in a block that influences future price direction.
- Golfing Candle: A strong single candle that confirms a potential POI when paired with other block signals.

### Assignment (practice)
- Locate and mark as many other blocks as you can on current charts.
- Note whether each block is bullish or bearish, and identify the source candle and the block's extent (including whether you include weeks/wicks).
- Report back on your results with details about:
  - Where you would place a buy or sell entry.
  - Where you would place stops and targets.
  - Any patterns or confirmations you observed (e.g., golfing candles, BOS occurrences, liquidity considerations).

### Final takeaway
- Other blocks are a fundamental POI in Smart Money Concepts that help identify likely reversal/continuation zones based on order flow and liquidity.
- Mastery comes from consistent practice, correct block drawing, understanding of context (BOS, liquidity), and applying disciplined risk management with clear entry/exit rules. Stay tuned for deeper coverage of AR calculations and more complex setups in future videos.
