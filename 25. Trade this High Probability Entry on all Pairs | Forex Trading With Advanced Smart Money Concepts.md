## Study Guide: High-Probability Entry Models (Multi-Time Frame Order Block Strategy)

### 1) What this guide covers
- A multi-time-frame approach to high-probability entry setups using order blocks (OBs) on different time frames.
- How to enter trades with confirmation, targeting liquidity/profit zones, and how this method applies across assets (FX, crypto, equities).
- Practical steps, examples, and testing tips to build confidence.

### 2) Key concepts and terminology
- Order Block (OB): A price zone on a higher time frame where large buying or selling activity previously occurred, often acting as a resistance (sell OB) or support (buy OB) zone.
- Higher Time Frame OB: The primary OB identified on a longer time frame (e.g., daily or 4-hour) that represents a major supply/demand zone.
- Lower Time Frame OB: An OB on a shorter time frame (e.g., 1-hour) used for precise entry timing.
- Break and Retest: Price breaks a block or support/resistance zone and then returns to retest that zone, offering a potential entry opportunity.
- Confirmation Entry: Waiting for price to retest the lower-time-frame OB (or a related criterion like a fair value gap) before entering the trade.
- Fair Value Gap (FVG): A price gap on a chart that can act as a POI (proof of interest) for entries or confirmations.
- Liquidity/TP (Take Profit) Targets: The next liquidity area or a logical profit target beyond the immediate OB, often a measure of “where price is likely to move to next.”
- Trend Break Context: Recognizing a trend line break or other structural shifts that reinforce an OB-based entry.

### 3) Structural setup (multi-time frame entry model)
- Overall idea: Use a higher time frame OB to define the major supply/demand area, then use a lower time frame OB to time an entry with confirmation.
- Step-by-step:
  1. Identify a significant higher time frame OB (e.g., daily/4-hour). This is your main reference block for the move.
  2. Mark the lower time frame OB that aligns with the expected retest area once price moves toward the higher TF OB.
  3. Wait for price to retrace back to the lower time frame OB (or a related confirmation zone such as a fair value gap) for entry.
  4. Enter on the retest of the lower time frame OB, rather than entering at the first touch of the higher TF OB.
  5. Set profit targets at the next liquidity/OB zones, i.e., the next expected supply/demand level or a logical TP area.
  6. Use trend context (like a prior trend line break) as additional confirmation to support the trade direction.
- Why this works: The higher TF OB represents a major inflection point with high consequence moves; waiting for a retest on a lower TF OB provides a precise entry with better risk management.

### 4) Buy setup (long) – practical pattern
- Find a bullish context:
  - Higher TF OB is a buy-side support area (or a demand zone).
  - Price breaks down below a line or structure but then retraces back toward the higher TF OB and/or a lower TF OB for a retest.
- Entry logic:
  - After price retests the lower time frame OB (or a related confirmation zone such as a fair value gap) within the OB region, enter long.
  - Sometimes traders enter on the second retest or after a specific pullback within the OB region, depending on their risk tolerance and confirmation signals.
- Target/TP:
  - Target the next liquidity zone or the next major OB in the price structure.
  - Take partial profits or move stops to break-even as price tests subsequent OBs or liquidity pools.
- Visualization cue:
  - Higher TF OB defined; lower TF OB used for the entry.
  - Price retests the lower TF OB; entry executed on the retest or after confirming the retest.
  - Example pattern: Break of trend line, retest of lower TF OB, move up toward the next OB/TP.

### 5) Sell setup (short) – practical pattern
- Find a bearish context:
  - Higher TF OB is a sell-side block (supply zone) or a resistance/demand zone for shorts.
  - Price retraces back toward the OB zones on a lower time frame.
- Entry logic:
  - Wait for the price to re-enter or retest the higher TF OB or the lower TF OB zone after a break/structure shift.
  - Enter short on the retest of the lower time frame OB or a confirmed entry zone (e.g., FVG, 0.618–0.786 retracement region on the lower TF).
- Target/TP:
  - Target the next liquidity zone below (the next major OB or a support/accumulation area).
  - Manage risk and consider trailing stops as price moves toward the target.
- Example patterns:
  - Break of a trend line followed by a return to the higher TF OB and a lower TF OB retest for a short entry.

### 6) Practical workflow and tips
- Time frame alignment:
  - Pick a higher time frame (e.g., 4-hour, daily) for the primary OB.
  - Use a lower time frame (e.g., 1-hour) for the entry trigger.
- Backtesting:
  - Backtest the concept on historical charts to build confidence before live trading.
  - Look for clear retest occurrences at the lower TF OB after price interacts with the higher TF OB.
- Confirmation criteria:
  - Retest of the lower TF OB.
  - Related confirmations such as a fair value gap (FVG) or a 0.618–0.786 retracement level.
  - Trend context (e.g., trend line break) to reinforce the trade direction.
- Patience with entries:
  - Do not always enter on the first touch of the higher TF OB; wait for the retest on the lower TF OB.
  - Use the lower TF OB as the official entry trigger to improve risk/reward.
- Risk considerations:
  - Define stop loss beyond the OB boundary or the immediate nearby structure, depending on volatility and time frame.
  - Position size should reflect your risk tolerance and the distance to the OB.

### 7) Example reasoning from the transcript (conceptual walkthrough)
- A buy setup example:
  - Identify a higher TF buy OB (demand zone) on a chart (e.g., daily).
  - Lower TF OB located in the same region is used to time an exact entry when price retests.
  - After the retest, enter long and target the next liquidity level beyond the immediate OB.
- A sell setup example:
  - Identify a higher TF sell OB (supply zone) on a chart.
  - Look for price to break and retest the lower TF OB or a fair value gap as confirmation for a short entry.
  - Enter short after confirmation and target the next liquidity zone below.

### 8) Practice tasks to reinforce learning
- Choose three assets (e.g., BTC/USDT, EUR/USD, and a stock index) and:
  - On the daily chart, mark a major higher TF OB (buy or sell) you would consider.
  - On a 1-hour chart, identify the corresponding lower TF OB that would be used for entry.
  - Look for a retest setup, confirm with an FVG or 0.618–0.786 retracement on the 1-hour frame, and plan a hypothetical entry.
  - Set TP targets at the next liquidity/OB zones and note potential stop loss placements.
- Document each scenario with:
  - The direction (long/short)
  - Higher TF OB description and price zone
  - Lower TF OB description and entry point
  - Confirmation criteria used
  - Entry price, stop loss, and target price
  - Rationale and notes on risk management

### 9) Additional resources and community
- The model is presented as a learning approach alongside other models covered in prior videos.
- Engage with the community for backtesting results, signals, and shared setups:
  - YouTube community posts
  - Telegram group for free signals and setups
  - Twitter/X handles for updates and examples
- Encourage backtesting and chart reviews to build familiarity and confidence before live trading.

### 10) Quick glossary
- OB (Order Block): Price zone indicative of institutional order flow and potential future resistance/support.
- HTF/HTF OB: Higher time frame order block (more significant, less frequent touches, higher impact).
- LTF/LTF OB: Lower time frame order block (used for precise entry timing).
- Break and Retest: Price breaks a zone and then returns to test it again, offering an entry opportunity.
- FVG (Fair Value Gap): A price gap indicating interest in a price level, used as a confirmation zone.
- Liquidity/TP: Areas where price is likely to move toward; used to define profit targets.
- Confirmation: Additional signals beyond the basic OB touch, such as a retest, FVG, or retracement level that strengthens an entry.

### Endnotes
- This guide consolidates the multi-time frame order block approach described in the transcript. The core idea is to combine a robust higher-time-frame OB with a precise lower-time-frame retest entry, supported by confirmations, to improve the probability of successful trades.
- Practice, backtest, and gradually incorporate into live trading to build confidence and refine risk controls.
