## Study Guide: Valid Order Blocks and Refinements (Point of Interest)

### Overview
- Focus: Understanding valid order blocks (often called “other blocks”) and refinements for trading decisions.
- Context: Part of a series on point of interest; emphasis on how to identify valid blocks, how to use them with liquidity concepts, and how to enter trades with sniper-like precision.
- Source perspective: Explanations include criteria to avoid fake/invalid blocks, examples of bullish and bearish blocks, and practical entry setups.

### Key Concepts
- Order Block (Order Block / Point of Interest)
  - A price zone where the market has shown strong order imbalances and is likely to attract future liquidity and reaction.
  - Used as a guide for potential entries, trend continuation, and retracements.
- Valid vs. Invalid (Fake) Blocks
  - A valid block has clear criteria indicating it is a credible source of liquidity and potential reaction zone.
  - An invalid block lacks one or more criteria and should be avoided for entries.
- Block Position
  - Bullish vs. Bearish Block:
    - Bearish block: typically a price area that precedes a downward move (source of selling pressure).
    - Bullish block: a price area that precedes an upward move (source of buying pressure).
- Golfing Bar
  - A candle after the block that signals continuation or rejection (bearish golfing bar or bullish golfing bar depending on block type).
- Liquidity and Liquidity Clearance
  - Weeks (wicks) or the candle itself can clear liquidity (trigger stop-loss and liquidate orders).
  - If the block’s weeks don’t clear liquidity, look for the candle that did clear liquidity.
- How to Draw and Refine Blocks
  - Use the block’s relevant candle or a candle with clear liquidity clearance to define the block’s extent.
  - Some traders use the entire candle; others prefer including/excluding the wick to refine the level.
- Practical Entry Concepts
  - Entry direction is aligned with the block’s implied move (buy near a bullish block, sell near a bearish block).
  - Stop loss placement: often just beyond the block or below/above the launch candle, depending on block type and chart structure.
  - Take profit/targeting: commonly target the nearest liquidity zone (the next major liquidity area) or a specific pre-determined level.

### Criteria to Evaluate a Potential Block (Checklist)
- Position of the Block
  - Is it bullish or bearish? Does this align with the intended trade direction?
- Golfing Bar Presence
  - Is there a supporting golfing bar after the block? Does it indicate continuation or rejection?
- Liquidity Clearance
  - Do the weeks clear liquidity around the block? If not, can you identify the candle that did clear liquidity?
- Clear Price Separation
  - Is the block clearly defined (distinct from nearby price action) to avoid ambiguity?
- Market Context
  - Is the overall trend supportive of trading in the direction suggested by the block?
  - Does the block form part of a clean trend leg or a pullback/resume pattern?

### Illustrative Scenarios (From Transcript)
- Bearish Block with Clear Liquidity
  - Bearish block forms in a downtrend.
  - The following candle prints a bearish action (golfing bar) and clears liquidity.
  - The block is drawn to the candle (or the candle’s extent) that cleared liquidity.
  - Entry could be a short position near the block, with stop loss beyond the block’s scope and target liquidity just below/at the next zone.
- Bullish Block in an Uptrend
  - Bullish block appears at a retracement or pullback within an uptrend.
  - The subsequent bullish move and the candle’s behavior (golfing bar) support continuation.
  - Entry could be a long position near the bullish block, with stop loss placed appropriately and target at the next liquidity zone or resistance.

### Common Techniques Mentioned
- Using the Block’s Source Candle
  - Some traders prefer to base the block strictly on the source candle (to avoid missing opportunities) for crisper entries.
- Using the Week/Candles to Define Block
  - Others refine by using the wick’s extent to shape the order block for potentially more precise timing.
- Combining Blocks with Other Concepts
  - The speaker mentions that later videos will connect order blocks with liquidity concepts (e.g., FVG/Fair Value Gap, gaps, and other liquidity considerations) for broader trading strategy.
- Real-World Entry Examples
  - Long trades: enter near bullish blocks; price moves higher to liquidity target.
  - Short trades: enter near bearish blocks; price moves lower to liquidity target.
- Self-Improvement Note
  - Emphasis on practice: backtest charts, observe live charts, and study examples in the community to improve understanding and timing.

### Glossary of Terms (as used in the video)
- Order Block / Other Block: a price zone where large players previously placed orders; used to anticipate future liquidity and reversals.
- Point of Interest: an area on the chart where traders expect price reaction due to accumulated orders.
- Golfing Bar: a candle after the block indicating continuation or rejection.
- Liquidity Clearance: the process of a candle (or wick) clearing liquidity by triggering stops and consuming buy/sell orders.
- FVG (Fair Value Gap): a price gap in value where price may return to “revisit” fair value; mentioned as a related concept for future coverage.
- Stop Loss (SL): a preset order to quickly exit a trade at a defined loss.
- Take Profit (TP): a preset exit level to secure profits.
- Trend Lines: lines used to identify general price direction (uptrend/downtrend) and to frame the block’s context.

### Practice Tasks
- Identify blocks on a chart:
  - Find a bearish block in a downtrend, check if there is a bullish golfing bar after it, and determine if liquidity was cleared.
  - Find a bullish block in an uptrend, check for a bearish golfing bar, and determine if liquidity was cleared.
- Evaluate validity:
  - For each block, run through the criteria: position (bullish/bearish), presence of golf bar, and liquidity clearance.
  - Mark any blocks that fail one or more criteria as invalid.
- Entry planning:
  - For a valid bearish block with cleared liquidity, plan a short entry, stop loss location, and a TP target at the next liquidity zone.
  - For a valid bullish block with cleared liquidity, plan a long entry, stop loss location, and a TP target at the next liquidity zone.
- Backtest correlation:
  - Review past chart examples or community backtests to see how blocks aligned with real moves and how entries played out.

### Key Takeaways
- A valid order block is a credible area where price previously stacked orders and is likely to react again, provided it meets criteria (block position, supporting golf bar, and liquidity clearance).
- Distinguish between valid and invalid blocks to avoid entering in non-promising zones.
- Understanding liquidity and how blocks interact with liquidity events helps in planning precise entries and targets.
- Practice across multiple charts and scenarios to build a higher win rate and better sniper-like entries.
