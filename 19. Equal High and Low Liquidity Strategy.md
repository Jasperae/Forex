### Study Guide: Liquidity in the Market (Horizontal vs Dynamic) with Equal Highs/Lows

### Overview
- Topic: Two types of liquidity in the market
  - Horizontal liquidity: focused around zones of equal highs and equal lows where orders cluster (stops, inducements, liquidity pools)
  - Dynamic liquidity: related to movement and retracements driven by price dynamics (to be covered in the next video)
- Focus of this guide: Horizontal liquidity, equal highs and equal lows, and how they interact with price action and entry ideas

### Key terms and concepts
- Equal Highs (EQ): A price zone where multiple highs are at approximately the same level, creating a liquidity area above which sellers may try to push price but liquidity sits there (orders, stops) that can attract buyers or trigger moves.
- Equal Lows (EL): A price zone where multiple lows are at approximately the same level, creating a liquidity area below which buyers may have placed stops and orders.
- Liquidity zone: An area where orders are concentrated (including stop losses, inducements, and resting orders). These zones often attract price to "sweep" liquidity.
- Inducement: A concept where the market teases or chases liquidity at a zone in order to trigger stops and move price through to another area. This often happens around EQ/EL zones.
- Fair Value Gap (FVG): A gap on the price chart where price left a discontinuity (a gap in price action). Can act as a target or an entry/exit zone when price revisits the zone.
- Entry setups (mentioned): 
  - One-to-five (1:5) setups: A referenced entry-target-risk framework used by the presenter (exact rules not fully specified in this video)
  - Entries near liquidity zones or FVGs, sometimes using confluences with other blocks/indicators
- Other blocks: Price confluence areas below/above liquidity zones that traders watch for potential entries or liquidity interactions

### What the video illustrates (conceptual walkthrough)
- Equal highs and equal lows form important liquidity areas where price often respects or moves through:
  - The market may come back to these zones to “collect” liquidity (stop losses, limit orders) before continuing its move.
  - The more orders resting at or near these zones, the stronger the incentive for the market to return to them to clear liquidity.
- The video uses a SOL/USD example to show:
  - A target high identified as a liquidity level (4.28 in the example) with multiple liquidity resting around it (two or more entries of liquidity shown as TP levels).
  - The market may visit the equal high region, clear liquidity, and then push higher or lower depending on the momentum and structure.
- Inducement and liquidity clearing:
  - The market can come to an equal high zone to clear liquidity above (trigger sells that were resting above) and then move through to the next zone.
  - Similarly, price may visit an equal low zone to collect buy stops before moving higher.
- Practical observation points:
  - Observe zones where price has repeatedly touched a high or low level without breaking through, indicating resting orders there.
  - Watch for price to sweep those zones and “clear” liquidity before continuing a larger move.
  - Note that sometimes multiple blocks/areas (like FVG or other blocks) interact with these zones, affecting entry opportunities or exclusion of some potential entries.

### Practical examples and trade thinking (as described)
- A chart example around SOL/USD illustrates:
  - A target high area with multiple liquidity resting there (around 4.28).
  - Several zones of liquidity (one or more “areas” where price interacted).
  - The market might first test/act around the equal high zone, then clear the liquidity before continuing in the anticipated direction.
  - If you’re using a specific entry model (e.g., fair value gap and other blocks), you can look for entries that align with the retrace into those liquidity zones or gaps, with stop losses placed beneath the liquidity zone for long setups.
- Specific trade notes:
  - If price retraces into a zone after liquidity is cleared elsewhere, you may gain an opportunity to enter long or short depending on the next balanced move.
  - If the liquidity in a zone is already cleared by another nearby zone, a direct entry on the later touch may not be valid (i.e., the first liquidity area has already been cleared, reducing the usefulness of a second entry there).
  - The presenter emphasizes that not every potential entry will trigger; sometimes stops will be hit and you’ll be taken out at break-even or small loss, which is normal in this framework.

### What to practice (assignments)
- Task 1: On any trading chart, identify regions of equal highs and equal lows (EQ and EL).
  - Mark these zones clearly on the chart.
  - Observe how the price action respects or interacts with these zones over several days/hours.
- Task 2: Look for liquidity sweeps around EQ/EL zones.
  - Note if price moves into the zone, sweeps liquidity, and then continues in the prior direction or reverses.
- Task 3: Correlate with other structures
  - Identify any nearby fair value gaps (FVG) or “other blocks” and observe how price interacts with these in conjunction with EQ/EL zones.
  - Evaluate entry opportunities that align with the confluence of EQ/EL with FVG or other blocks.
- Task 4: Use a simple objective
  - For a chosen zone, determine a primary target (nearest liquidity level on the other side) and a logical stop placement beneath/above the zone.
  - Track the outcome and refine where entries are placed relative to the zone and blocks.

### Tips and cautions
- Horizontal liquidity (EQ/EL zones) is about where money sits and where price often revisits to collect it. Expect price to move toward/through these zones to trigger stops and then continue in the intended direction.
- Not every price touch will yield a perfect entry; risk management (stops, position sizing) is essential as price can bounce or retrace before continuing.
- The video teases a future deeper dive into dynamic liquidity and to pair this understanding with equal-bound trends and TR lines (trendline liquidity). Stay tuned for more comprehensive coverage.

### Takeaways
- Horizontal liquidity centers on equal highs and equal lows as critical zones where resting orders attract price movement.
- Price often revisits these zones to “clear” liquidity before continuing a larger move.
- Use EQ/EL zones in combination with other signals (like FVGs or blocks) to identify potential entries.
- Practice identifying these zones on charts and observe real-price action to gain intuition for how liquidity influences market moves.

### Suggested next steps (to complement this video)
- Watch the next video on dynamic liquidity to contrast with horizontal liquidity.
- Practice charting EQ/EL zones on several currency pairs or crypto pairs to see how prevalent these patterns are.
- Experiment with entry ideas around EQ/EL zones using a small paper-trading or controlled-risk approach to learn how stops and targets interact with these liquidity events.
