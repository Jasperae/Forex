## Study Guide: High Probability Entry Models (Ex Models)

### Overview
- This guide summarizes the four high-probability entry models (ex models) discussed in the video.
- Ex models are price-structure setups with a high chance of playing out in the direction of the trend or a planned reversal.
- Key prerequisites: understanding Break of Structure (BoS), Change of Character (ChoCh), and Liquidity concepts (to be covered in a future video).
- Timeframes: typically analyze on higher timeframes for structure and use lower timeframes for entry confirmation (e.g., 1-hour for structure, 15-minute for entry confirmation).

### Important concepts to understand first
- Break of Structure (BoS): a break of a previously established price structure (e.g., lower highs/low lows) indicating a potential change in trend.
- Change of Character (ChoCh): a shift in market behavior that signals a potential trend change; essential to interpret correctly for ex models.
- Liquidity: zones where orders are likely to sit (order blocks, equal highs/lows, swing highs/lows). Price often moves to these zones to “probe” liquidity.
- Order blocks: areas where institutional traders previously pushed price; used as potential zones of interest for entries.
- Liquidity sweep: a move that “sweeps” liquidity (often a stop hunt) before continuing in a direction.
- Inducements: price action designed to lure participants into entering a trade at a suboptimal level, often used with consolidation patterns.

### Four high-probability entry models (ex models) explained

### 1) Ex Model 1: Change of Character + Liquidity Sweep (C-based entry model)
- What it is:
  - A price action setup where price shows a liquidity sweep, then moves into a defined area (order block) that serves as the point of interest (POI) for an entry.
- How it looks:
  - The market forms a clear BoS/ChoCh signal with a sweep of liquidity, then returns to test an order block.
- How to trade:
  - Entry is taken at the lower time frame after the market sweeps liquidity and returns to test the order block.
  - Example entry logic:
    - On 1-hour chart: wait for a sell setup (downtrend with a liquidity sweep).
    - Move to a lower time frame (e.g., 15-minute) and wait for a break of a significant low, then a test of an order block.
    - Enter long (buy) once price returns to the order block region with a buy stop placed above/near the block.
    - Place stop loss beneath the order block; target a higher-probability take profit based on liquidity and structure.
- Notes:
  - This model is a direct, clear example of ChoCh and liquidity in action.
  - Can be back-tested on past charts to verify probability.
- Practical takeaway:
  - Use as a primary entry when you clearly see a liquidity sweep, followed by a test of an order block and a favorable risk-reward.

### 2) Ex Model 2: Consolidation Breakout with Breakout Re-test (IND model)
- What it is:
  - A consolidation area where price builds a range (inducing ambiguity). A breakout move is followed by a retracement back to an order block for an entry.
- How it looks:
  - Price is in a downtrend and pulls back (lower high), then makes a lower low; price breaks the last low, then pushes higher and retraces back toward the order block region.
- How to trade:
  - After the breakout of the lower low and a subsequent movement above the prior high, wait for a retrace back to the order block to enter long.
  - Place a long entry (buy) around the order block region with a stop loss beneath the order block.
  - Target range liquidity and then a higher target (e.g., 1.5x or more) depending on setup.
- Notes:
  - This model is described as “dangerous” because consolidation breakouts can fail or retrace to clear liquidity.
  - It can still be profitable if you manage risk and wait for a proper pullback to the order block before entering.
- Practical takeaway:
  - Use this as a confirmation entry after a consolidation breakout, ensuring the retracement lands on the order block region before entering.

### 3) Ex Model 3: Shoulder-Head-Like Pattern with Liquidity Concentration (SMC-inspired approach)
- What it is:
  - A pattern resembling a shoulder-head-shoulder (SHS) structure or a similar liquidity-based pattern, where liquidity sits at equal highs and equal lows.
  - The price drops, creates a liquidity zone, breaks the structure to the upside, then retraces to the order block for entry.
- How it looks:
  - Price moves down, forms a region of liquidity, breaks up through this region, then returns to test an order block.
- How to trade:
  - Enter long at the order block after price returns to the targeted block, with stop loss placed below the order block.
  - Target higher liquidity zones or a defined take-profit level (TP around 1.5x or more, depending on the setup).
- Notes:
  - This model emphasizes that liquidity is concentrated at certain price levels (equal highs/lows).
  - It leverages a probability-based approach to buy after liquidity is swept and price returns to a high-probability level.
- Practical takeaway:
  - Recognize the liquidity zones (equal highs/equal lows) and wait for price to return to the order block before entry.

### 4) Ex Model 4: Consolidation Break (Inducement/Reaction to Liquidity)
- What it is:
  - A long-entry scenario where price consolidates, then breaks out with a move that appears as an inducement (a lure) but ultimately uses liquidity to drive the next leg.
- How it looks:
  - The market consolidates (sideways range). It breaks out with a movement that appears to trap order flow, then pulls back to an order block and moves higher.
- How to trade:
  - Enter long at the subsequent pullback to a nearby order block (the “other block” region).
  - Place a stop loss below the order block.
  - Target a reasonable multiple of risk (e.g., 1.5x or higher, depending on structure and liquidity).
- Notes:
  - This model involves “engineered liquidity” scenarios where price manipulates liquidity before continuing.
  - It can be riskier due to potential pullbacks to clear liquidity, but can be profitable with strict risk management and proper timing.
- Practical takeaway:
  - Look for consolidation followed by a breakout and a retracement to a nearby order block as the signal to enter long.

### How to apply these models in practice
- Step-by-step approach:
  - Step 1: Identify the higher-timeframe structure and confirm a trend or setup (BoS/ChoCh context).
  - Step 2: Look for an ex model signal on a lower timeframe (e.g., 1-hour or lower), such as a liquidity sweep, consolidation breakout, or identifiable order blocks.
  - Step 3: Switch to an even lower timeframe (e.g., 15-minute) to confirm the entry pullback to the order block or POI.
  - Step 4: Enter with a pending order (buy stop or sell stop as appropriate) around the POI/order block region.
  - Step 5: Place stop loss beneath the order block or a nearby protective level.
  - Step 6: Set a take-profit target based on liquidity zones, prior structure, or a defined risk-reward (e.g., 1.5x or 2x).
- Risk management:
  - Avoid excessive leverage; ensure risk per trade is manageable.
  - Use clear stop losses beneath order blocks or significant reference levels (e.g., beneath the order block for buys).
  - Confirm entries with multiple timeframes to reduce false signals.
- Backtesting and practice:
  - Take screenshots or note down setups from historical charts and backtest each model.
  - Practice identifying liquidity zones, order blocks, and consolidation patterns in multiple markets and timeframes.

### Key reminders
- These models rely on understanding BoS and ChoCh; ensure you’re comfortable with those concepts first.
- Liquidity concepts are essential to recognizing where price may react, bounce, or trigger entries.
- The speaker mentioned a future video to cover liquidity in depth; stay tuned for that topic.
- Engage with the community to see live setups and feedback (YouTube community, Telegram, etc.).

### Suggested study activities
- Review past charts and try to identify:
  - A liquidity sweep followed by an order block test (Model 1).
  - A consolidation breakout with a retrace to an order block (Model 2).
  - A SHS-like pattern with liquidity concentration and order block test (Model 3).
  - A consolidation breakout with inducement and a retrace (Model 4).
- Practice notes:
  - Mark the POI/order block region on lower timeframe charts for each identified setup.
  - Mark stop-loss placement and take-profit targets based on structure and liquidity analysis.
- Join and observe community setups:
  - Telegram and YouTube community posts to see real-time examples and updates.

### What’s coming next (to look out for)
- A dedicated video on liquidity concepts (to deepen understanding of liquidity zones and how to apply them with ex models).
- Additional entry models beyond the four discussed, as well as how to handle different market conditions.

If you want more help, you can:
- Pull up a chart and try to map these four models onto a recent price move.
- Share your annotated charts with notes on how the entry, stop, and target would be placed according to each model.
