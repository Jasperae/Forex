### Study Guide: Mitigation in Trading

### Key concepts
- Mitigation: When price touches a zone (often defined as an order block or a defined support/resistance area) that has already been tapped once, that zone’s power to push profits back in the same direction weakens with each subsequent touch.
- Mitigated zone: A zone that has already been tapped/touched and used by the market. Its ability to hold and generate a strong move is reduced after being mitigated.
- Unmitigated zone: A zone that has not yet been touched by the price. It remains a valid target area for potential price reaction.
- Other block: A concept referenced as the construction around the zone used to identify the mitigation area (part of the zone setup the speaker uses).
- Liquidity concept (brief awareness): The idea that price may move to collect liquidity above a zone before moving in the opposite direction. This is mentioned as a related concept, not the main focus of mitigation.

### What mitigation means in practice
- When a zone is tapped for the first time, it is considered mitigated: the likelihood of strong reverse movement from that exact touch is present, but the zone’s strength decreases with subsequent touches.
- A zone that has not been touched yet remains a strong potential area for a trading setup (unmitigated).
- The more times a zone is touched, the weaker its predictive power becomes for future moves from that zone.

### Trading implications
- Use mitigation awareness to evaluate where the market may reverse or pull back after touching a zone.
- Do not rely on a previously tapped zone to produce the same strength of profit as the first tap; the probability of a strong reaction decreases with each subsequent touch.
- When a new unmitigated zone forms, it can present a fresh opportunity for a planned trade, with the expectation that the zone has not yet been compromised by prior touches.
- The concept can be combined with stop-loss (SL) strategies and other risk controls to manage positions around mitigated vs unmitigated zones.

### How to apply mitigation in your charting
- Identify zones (likely using defined blocks or order blocks around price action).
- Mark which zones have been tapped (mitigated) and which have not (unmitigated).
- Expect stronger reactions from unmitigated zones upon first touch; be more cautious about profit targets and entries at mitigated zones.
- If price returns to a mitigated zone, anticipate a weaker or less reliable move and adjust expectations accordingly.
- Monitor price behavior around these zones for potential entries when an unmitigated zone is reached again, using appropriate risk management.

### Key terms to know
- Zone: A defined price area, often around a previous price move or order block, used for planning entries and exits.
- Tapped / touched: Price has reached the zone and interacted with it (entered the zone).
- Mitigated: The zone has been tapped previously and is considered weaker for future strong moves.
- Unmitigated: The zone has not yet been touched and remains a valid setup area.
- Liquidity (mentioned as a related idea): Price may move to collect liquidity above a zone, which can influence market moves; this is noted as a broader market behavior topic.

### Common questions and clarifications
- Does mitigation always yield a profit? No. mititgation reduces the strength of the zone's reaction with each touch; it does not guarantee profit, but affects the likelihood and strength of moves.
- How do I know if a zone is mitigated? Track price interactions: if a zone has been touched/tapped previously, it is considered mitigated. A zone that has not been touched is unmitigated.
- Should I ignore mitigated zones entirely? Not necessarily. They can still provide context, but expect weaker outcomes. Prioritize unmitigated zones for potential higher-probability moves and manage risk around mitigated zones.

### Practical study tips
- Practice identifying zones on historical charts and labeling them as mitigated or unmitigated based on prior touches.
- Observe how price behaves at unmitigated zones versus mitigated zones in past price action.
- Combine mitigation awareness with a simple risk management plan (entry criteria, stop loss, take profit) to test how it affects win rate and risk-reward.
- Create a checklist for each trade setup:
  - Is the zone unmitigated or mitigated?
  - What is the price action at first touch of an unmitigated zone?
  - What are my risk parameters (SL, position size)?
  - What is the expected move direction and potential profit target?
  - What is the probability-adjusted expectation based on zone status?

### Next steps and resources
- Practice on charts: identify zones, mark mitigated vs unmitigated, and simulate trades.
- If you want more trading setups and community insights, engage with related channels and communities mentioned in the video (e.g., messaging groups, social media channels, and trading communities).
- Keep learning about related concepts (like liquidity-driven moves) as supplementary context to mitigation, but focus on the core idea: the predictive power of zones diminishes with each mitigation touch.

### Summary
- Mitigation is about how the first tap on a zone has the strongest potential reaction, with diminishing strength on subsequent touches.
- Unmitigated zones are still strong candidate areas; mitigated zones require more caution.
- Apply this concept with clear risk management to improve decision-making around entry points and targets in your trading plan.
