## Study Guide: Multi-Time Frame Analysis (MFTA)

### Purpose
- Use multiple time frames to align market direction with your trade entries.
- Improve accuracy by checking trend on a higher time frame and pinpointing entry on a lower (or main) time frame.

### Key Concepts and Definitions
- Time frames in trading view:
  - Higher time frame: the broader trend (e.g., 4 hours, daily, weekly, monthly).
  - Main time frame: the time frame you actively analyze for setups (often the one you use to identify the trade direction; in the example, 1-hour).
  - Lower time frame: used for sniper entries or finer market structure (e.g., 15 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 minute).
- Trend direction:
  - Bullish market: price making higher highs and higher lows; prefer long entries (buy).
  - Bearish market: price making lower highs and lower lows; prefer short entries (sell).
- Structure concepts (brief references from the talk):
  - Break of Structure: a price move that breaks a previous swing point, indicating a potential continuation or reversal.
  - Change of Character (CoC): a shift in how price behaves, signaling a potential trend change.
  - Order blocks / inducement (context used in the video): referenced as locations where price might react; used as reference zones for entries.
- Entry model (pattern used in the video):
  - A predefined setup you recognize on your main time frame that triggers an entry when the market reaches a certain zone.
  - The speaker emphasizes letting the entry model play out on the main time frame and using limit orders for entry.
- sniper entries (on the lower time frame):
  - Some traders wait for specific pullbacks or retests on the lower time frame to enter with tighter criteria.
  - In the example, lower time frame entries are considered after a break and retest pattern appears.

### What time frames to use (example from the video)
- Higher time frame options: 4 hours, daily, 1 month (to establish long-term trend direction).
- Main time frame (the trader uses this for the core setup): 1 hour.
- Lower time frame (for entries): 15 minutes (sometimes used by traders to refine entry after the main setup forms).

### The workflow (step-by-step)
1. Set your time frames:
   - Decide which frame is your higher time frame (helps identify overall trend).
   - Decide which frame is your main time frame (where you identify your entry setup).
   - Decide which frame is your lower time frame (for additional entry precision, if desired).
2. Determine market direction on the higher time frame:
   - Switch to the higher time frame (e.g., 4-hour or daily) and assess the trend.
   - Determine if the market is bullish or bearish and the likely direction of movement.
3. Confirm with the main time frame:
   - Go to your main time frame (e.g., 1-hour).
   - Look for the entry setup that aligns with the higher time frame trend (e.g., break of structure to the upside in a bullish market).
   - If the higher time frame shows bullishness, you search for long entries on the main time frame; avoid trades against the trend.
4. Execute using the entry model:
   - When the main time frame “entry model” fires, consider entering (often with a limit order).
   - Use the space around the entry and manage risk with a stop loss.
5. Optional lower time frame refinement:
   - If using the lower time frame (e.g., 15 minutes), wait for a pullback or retest after the initial move, confirming the entry signal.
   - Enter on the lower time frame after confirmation, if your strategy requires it.
6. Risk and targets:
   - Manage risk with appropriate stop loss placement at nearby structure points.
   - Set profit targets, often aiming for higher targets when the movement aligns with the higher time frame trend.
   - Some traders target multiple reward-to-risk (e.g., 4:1 or higher) by maximizing the move in the direction of the trend.

### Practical observations from the example in the transcript
- The speaker uses an “AXS/USC” (cryptocurrency) example on a 1-hour main time frame.
- Higher time frame (4-hour) shows bullish direction, guiding the trader to look for long entries on the 1-hour main time frame.
- The 1-hour chart is used to identify the entry model; the trader executes with limit orders rather than chasing the market.
- Some traders on the 15-minute lower time frame would wait for a break and retest before entering, seeking a sniper entry; others (as described) rely on the main time frame entry model and do not continuously scan for lower-time-frame entries.
- The trader emphasizes trading with the trend (not against it) and only looking for changes in character or break of structure patterns to justify the entry.
- The video promises to cover lower time frame trading in a future video.

### Entry and trade management tips
- Always start with the higher time frame to establish the market direction.
- Use the main time frame for the primary setup and entry decisions.
- Consider a lower time frame for an optional refinement of entry, but it’s not strictly required for all setups.
- Use limit orders where possible to improve entry precision and to avoid chasing the market.
- Do not try to chase every move; wait for your entry model to trigger in alignment with the higher time frame trend.
- Be mindful of risk management: set stop losses based on structure (e.g., below a swing low for longs or above a swing high for shorts) and aim for multi-bar targets.
- Monitor for changes in market character or structure that may indicate a shift in trend.

### What to practice (study plan)
- Practice identifying trend direction on a higher time frame (e.g., 4-hour and daily charts for a given asset).
- Practice recognizing a clear setup on the main time frame (1-hour): break of structure, order blocks, or the described entry model.
- Practice scanning a lower time frame (15-minute) for potential sniper entries only after the main frame setup is confirmed.
- Practice placing limit orders at the anticipated entry zone and setting stop losses based on nearby structure.
- Review past trades to see whether your trades followed the MFTA logic and where you could improve.

### Quick reference checklist
- [ ] Define higher time frame (trend direction).
- [ ] Define main time frame (primary setup/entry framework).
- [ ] Define lower time frame (optional entry refinement).
- [ ] Confirm bullish/bearish condition on higher time frame.
- [ ] Look for entry setup on main time frame aligned with higher time frame direction.
- [ ] Enter with limit order when the entry model triggers.
- [ ] Place stop loss at a logical level near structure (swing low/high or nearby blocks).
- [ ] Optional: check lower time frame for a secondary entry signal after a break/retest.
- [ ] Manage risk and aim for targets that reflect the higher time frame trend.

### Notes
- The video is part of a trading education series and references a specific entry model the speaker uses regularly.
- The emphasis is on trading with the trend and using higher time frames to guide decisions, with lower time frames used to refine entries when desired.
- The speaker plans to cover lower time frame trading in a future video.

If you’d like, I can tailor this guide to a specific asset or time frames you prefer and add a sample workflow with a hypothetical example.
