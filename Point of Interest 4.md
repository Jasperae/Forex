### Study Guide: Point of Interest Four – Valid Breaker Blocks

### Overview
- This lesson continues a series on Points of Interest (POI) in the context of price action trading.
- Focus: Valid breaker blocks (as POI four).
- Key idea: A valid breaker block is a specific pattern that signals a potential shift in market structure and a retrace/retest following a breakout.

### What is a breaker block?
- A breaker block is a price structure that forms when a previous block is broken, followed by a retest and a move in the opposite direction (trend continues after the retest).
- Valid breaker block specifics:
  - It should be formed by impulsive price action.
  - It should include fair value gaps (FVGs).
  - It should have clearly defined invalidating (invalidating) zones.

### Three main criteria for a valid breaker block
1) Impulsive candles
   - The block is driven by strong, impulsive candles (not small, indecisive moves).
   - Impulsive movement signals strong pressure in the direction of the breakout.

2) Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
   - The setup should involve fair value gaps within the block’s structure.
   - In practice, FVGs are gaps created between candles where price didn’t trade in a certain range; they are often depicted as “weeks” between candles (for weekly-based FVGs) or intra-candle gaps depending on the chart type.
   - The presence of an FVG helps confirm the strength/likelihood of a breakout and subsequent retrace.

3) Invalidating zones (IV) or invalidating zones
   - There are zones that, if breached, invalidate the trade setup.
   - An invalidating zone is a price area where if the price moves beyond it, the breaker block setup is no longer valid.
   - The idea is to place stops/entries in a way that acknowledges these zones to avoid premature entries and false breakouts.

### Practical understanding with examples (as described in the video)
- A valid breaker block example:
  - There is a prior block; price breaks through it, then retests.
  - The breakout is driven by impulsive candles.
  - FVGs are present within the block structure.
  - Clear invalidating zones exist; if price moves beyond these zones, the trade idea is invalidated.

- A fake (invalid) breaker block example:
  - The move is not impulsive (small, weak candles).
  - Lacks impulsive candles, or lacks a fair value gap, or lacks clear invalidating zones.
  - Thus, this setup should not be treated as a valid breaker block.

### Entry considerations (how to place trades using a valid breaker block)
- Entry point: Typically at or after: the end of the break block once it becomes a breaker block and the market starts to retrace.
- Positioning: Entries are placed with awareness of the valid breaker block becoming a breaker (i.e., after the breakout and on the retrace).
- Stop placement: Consider the invalidating zones; place stops beyond the invalidating zone to avoid being drawn into a false move.
- Profit targets: Use the structure’s subsequent price action, liquidity draws, and continuation patterns. The idea is to ride the eventual move in the direction of the break after the retest and not get caught by premature reversals.

### Important concepts tied to POI Four
- Liquidity and order flow: Breaker blocks can be used to understand where liquidity is being taken (e.g., the market sweeps liquidity to collect orders before continuing the move).
- Retest behavior: After a breakout block forms, price often retests before continuing in the breakout direction or reverses—this is a critical moment to confirm the validity of the setup.
- Context within the series: POI four builds on learnings from POI one (cost/order blocks), POI two (valid order blocks), and POI three (breakers). Viewed as a series, validating a breaker block is a logical next step in recognizing high-probability setups.

### Practical tips and cautions
- Fake breakers exist: Not every breakout followed by a retest is valid. Always check impulsiveness, FVGs, and IV zones.
- Use multiple confirmations: Impulsive candles + FVG presence + IV zones together strengthen the validity of the setup.
- Don’t overfit the entry: If the price barely breaches an area but doesn’t fulfill the impulsive/IV/FVG criteria, treat it with caution.
- Use the knowledge of breaker blocks to understand market behavior: They can indicate liquidity grabs and potential continuation after the retest.

### How to study and apply (practice ideas)
- Identify examples on charts:
  - Look for a rapid breakout with strong candles, followed by a retrace to near the broken level.
  - Check if there are visible fair value gaps within the move and the block.
  - Mark possible invalidating zones and test if price respects them or breaches them.
- Compare two scenarios:
  - A valid breaker block vs a fake breaker block. Note the differences in candle impulsiveness, presence of FVG, and behavior around invalidating zones.
- Backtest mentally or on historical charts:
  - Find instances of valid breaker blocks and observe the subsequent price action, whether the price respects the IV zones and whether the move after the retest continues in the expected direction.

### What to remember
- A valid breaker block is defined by three criteria:
  - Impulsive candles
  - Fair value gaps (FVGs)
  - Invalidating zones
- A fake breaker block lacks one or more of these criteria (especially impulsive movement).
- Use the pattern to anticipate liquidity behavior, entry timing, and potential continuation after a retest.

### Practice questions
- Given a chart, identify whether a breaker block is valid. List which criteria are satisfied or not.
- On a recent breakout, locate the FVGs and the invalidating zones. Determine if a potential entry aligns with the valid breaker block concept.
- Compare two similar setups: one is a valid breaker block and the other is not. Note the differences and explain why one is higher-probability than the other.
- Describe how knowledge of breaker blocks could inform your liquidity awareness and how you would place a stop and target around the IV zones.
