### Study Guide: Fair Value Gaps (FVG) and Imbalances

### Overview
- Topic: Understanding fair value gaps (FVG) and market imbalances within technical analysis, focused on points of interest.
- Context: Part of a series on technical analysis and points of interest; emphasis on how FVGs form, how to mark them, and how to trade them (often in combination with other concepts like liquidity and order blocks).

### Key Concepts
- Fair Value Gap (FVG)
  - Definition: An inefficiency in the market where there is an imbalance of orders, typically created when the market moves strongly in one direction due to many buy or sell orders, leaving a “gap” (unfilled price range) between the first and third candles’ weeks.
  - Visual intuition: A gap between the low of the first candle’s week and the high of the third candle’s week in a bullish or bearish context.
  - Purpose: Indicates an area where price may return to “revisit” fair value and fill the gap, creating potential trading opportunities.
- Imbalances
  - Related concept to FVGs: When there are more buyers than sellers (or vice versa), causing a price move away from the balance and leaving an inefficiency that may be revisited.

### Marking Fair Value Gaps
- Basic approach (two main methods):
  1) Rectangle method
     - Identify the gap between the first candle’s week and the third candle’s week.
     - Draw a rectangle spanning the price range of the gap (the space between those two weeks).
     - This rectangle marks the FVG area to watch.
  2) Trend-line (line) method
     - Click to start at the week’s high/low, then use the Shift key to draw a straight line (trend line) across the weeks that define the gap.
     - Extend to cover the gap zone; color and line style can be customized.
  3) Horizontal/line extension method (freehand)
     - Use a drawing tool to connect the gap’s boundaries horizontally, extending lines to cover the gap area.
     - Color and width adjustments can help visibility.
- Practical tips for marking:
  - Use whichever method feels most clear to you (rectangles, trend lines, or horizontal lines).
  - Keep visual clarity consistent to avoid confusing other chart elements.
  - Don’t mix too many marking styles in one chart; pick a consistent approach.

### Trading with Fair Value Gaps
- Core idea: When a bearish FVG is formed (gap in downward movement), anticipate price returning to the gap region to retrace. When a bullish FVG is formed (gap in upward movement), anticipate a retracement or pullback into the gap area before continuation.
- Bearish FVG trading setup
  - Identify a bearish FVG (gap created during a down move).
  - Expect price to come back to the gap zone (the FVG area).
  - Enter a short (sell) position when price returns to/near the FVG zone.
  - Risk management: Place stop loss above the FVG zone.
  - Profit targets: Target liquidity areas/nearest liquidity pockets or predefined price structure resistance levels, potentially using multiple take-profits.
- Bullish FVG trading setup
  - Identify a bullish FVG (gap created during an up move).
  - Expect price to retrace into the FVG zone before resuming the upward move.
  - Enter a long (buy) position when price returns to/near the FVG zone.
  - Risk management: Place stop loss below the FVG zone.
  - Profit targets: Target price movement ranges or liquidity levels above; adjust depending on liquidity and market structure.
- Practical note on execution
  - Use limit orders to enter near the gap zone if you have a specific entry area.
  - In some cases, you may observe the market moving through the FVG without a clear retrace; assess the probability and adjust entries accordingly.
  - Liquidity-based targets often guide take-profit levels (e.g., nearest liquidity pockets).

### Live/Practical Examples (as described in the transcript)
- A real-time discussion described missed entry on a USD/CHF-like scenario due to sleeping, illustrating how opportunities can exist in both directions.
- A BTC/USD chart example (on BTC/USDT) was used to explain:
  - Spotting the February FVG on a larger time frame (daily) and drilling down to lower time frames (1-hour, 4-hour) to identify a potential entry zone.
  - Use of a boundary line (week’s high/low) to define the gap and a plan to enter when price revisits this zone.
  - The speaker notes that price may not always trigger the trade, emphasizing the probabilistic nature of such setups and the importance of patience and proper risk management.
- Takeaway from the live example:
  - FVGs can exist across multiple time frames; both high and low time frames can help in spotting and confirming the gap.
  - Traders may have differing outcomes depending on entry timing and market conditions.

### Practical Assignment (for learners)
- Task: On BTC/USD (or any chosen chart), identify and mark a fair value gap (FVG) using your preferred marking method (rectangle, trend line, or freehand lines).
- Steps:
  - Determine the direction of the trend (bullish or bearish context) and locate the corresponding FVG formed by the gap between the first and third candle weeks.
  - Mark the FVG area precisely.
  - Observe how price interacts with the FVG in the subsequent candles or price action.
  - Plan a hypothetical trade: decide whether to enter on pullback into the FVG, set stop loss, and identify a target (liquidity zone or resistance level).
  - Compare outcomes across different time frames (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, daily) to understand how the gap behaves with different levels of data.
- Opportunity note: The instructor suggests reviewing setups posted in their Telegram community for practical, real-time examples and learning how FVGs combine with other concepts (like order blocks or liquidity concepts) for more robust trading.

### Additional tips
- FVGs are not a standalone trading signal; they are best used in combination with other concepts (order blocks, liquidity, structure breaks).
- Backtesting and live practice are important; backtest FVG strategies to understand probability and reliability in different markets.
- When learning, keep your charts clean and consistent with a single marking approach to reduce confusion.
- Join the community for additional setups and real-time examples to see how FVGs play out in different market conditions.

### What you should do next
- Watch for a live example or practice identifying FVGs on your own charts.
- Practice marking FVGs using at least two methods (rectangle and trend-line) to determine which you prefer.
- Try a small, simulated or paper trade on a chart where an FVG is clearly formed, testing both bearish and bullish setups in different market conditions.
- If you’re following along in the creator’s series, check for upcoming videos on related concepts (e.g., combining FVG with the RTO concept) to expand your toolkit.

#### Remember: The goal of studying fair value gaps is to understand where price may revisit and how to structure trades that align with that potential reversion, while managing risk through clear stop losses and liquidity-based targets.
