  A: They are not just textbook definitions; they happen in real markets and can be observed on charts.

- Q: What is the suggested way to learn these concepts beyond definitions?
  A: Backtest and study real market charts to see how the patterns play out.

  Flash Cards: Market Structure Concepts

1)
Front: What is a rally?

- Q: What does a "rally base drop" pattern describe?
  A: An upward move (rally) to a base, then a drop.

- Q: What future concept does the host say will be discussed next?
  A: Premium and discount levels under Market Structure.

- Q: What is one tip the host gives about understanding the market?
  A: The market follows systemic patterns; it doesn’t jump randomly, it moves through recognizable structures.

- Q: How does the host suggest you verify the patterns on different assets?
  A: By applying the same rally/base/drop concepts to different pairs like GBP/USD and BTC/USD and observing the patterns across multiple timeframes.
