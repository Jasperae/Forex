## Study Guide: Market Structure and Substructure

### Key concepts
- Market structure: The overall direction and framework of price movement on a higher time frame (HTF). It defines the main trend (uptrend, downtrend, or range) and major swings.
- Substructure: The smaller price movements within the main structure observed on a lower time frame (LTF). These are the pullbacks, retracements, and corrections inside the HTF trend.
- Higher time frame (HTF) vs lower time frame (LTF):
  - HTF shows the primary structure (e.g., daily time frame).
  - LTF reveals the substructure (e.g., 1-hour, 15-minute).
- Higher highs and higher lows describe an uptrend on the HTF: each swing high is higher than the previous high, and each swing low is higher than the previous low.
- Pullbacks and consolidations: Even within an uptrend on the HTF, the price may move down or sideways on the LTF before continuing higher.
- Time frame relationship: The HTF is used to identify the main trend; the LTF is used to observe the substructure and to look for entry opportunities (confirmations discussed in future videos).

### Practical insights
- Structure vs substructure relationship:
  - Structure = the main market direction on the HTF (the larger swing series).
  - Substructure = the smaller price moves on the LTF that occur within the HTF structure.
- Entry considerations (mentioned as coming in a future video): Substructure can be used to find confirmation entries, but focus on the HTF structure first.
- Example frames:
  - 1) Daily time frame (HTF) + 1-hour time frame (LTF)
  - 2) 1-hour time frame (HTF) + 15-minute time frame (LTF)
  - Note: The higher time frame is the one that defines the main structure; the lower time frame shows substructure.
- Alternative time frames: You can use weekly/monthly/yearly as HTF and daily/4-hour as LTF, etc.

### Chart observations (from the transcript)
- BTC/USD example on daily: Long-term uptrend with higher highs and higher lows.
- On the 1-hour time frame (within the daily uptrend): Price moves up, then pulls back (down move), then moves up again, showing substructure within the daily uptrend.
- Daily view can appear as a smooth up move, while the 1-hour view reveals the pullbacks and consolidation within that uptrend.

### Assignment and practice
- Apply the concepts to EUR/USD:
  - Open EUR/USD chart.
  - Choose a HTF (e.g., daily) and identify the main structure (uptrend, downtrend, or range).
  - Switch to a lower time frame (e.g., 1-hour or 15-minute) and identify the substructure (pullbacks and local swings).
  - Compare what the HTF shows vs what the LTF shows to see how substructure appears inside the main structure.
- If you don’t use TradingView yet, set up a charting platform to practice identifying HTF structure and LTF substructure.

### Practical setup tips
- Chart setup: Have two time frames visible (HTF and LTF) to compare structure and substructure.
- Time frame labeling: Note which time frame is HTF (higher) and which is LTF (lower) in any given pair.
- Real-time observation: Look for consistent higher highs and higher lows on HTF to define an uptrend, then observe corresponding pullbacks on LTF within that trend.

### Upcoming topics mentioned
- Rally-based and drop-based price movements: How rallies and drops fit into market structure (to be covered in the next video).

### What to remember
- Structure is the bigger picture on a higher time frame.
- Substructure is the smaller patterns within that bigger picture on a lower time frame.
- Use HTF to identify trend direction; use LTF to see pullbacks and potential entries (to be expanded in future lessons).

### Suggested practice routine
- Pick a currency pair (e.g., EUR/USD or BTC/USD).
- On HTF (daily or 1-hour), identify the main trend and major swing highs/lows.
- Move to a lower time frame (1-hour or 15-minute) and map the substructure: where are the pullbacks, consolidations, and minor swings?
- Repeat across multiple market conditions (rising market, consolidating market, pulling back within a trend).

### Notes
- This guide reflects the concepts as presented in the video: structure vs substructure, HTF vs LTF, and the example BTC/USD across daily and 1-hour time frames.
- Future videos will cover confirmation entries and rally-based vs drop-based movements in more detail.

- Q: What is the topic of the video?
  A: Market structure and substructure, and how time frames affect them.

- Q: In market structure, what is the "structure"?
  A: The higher-level movement of the market on a higher time frame (e.g., higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend).

- Q: In market structure, what is the "substructure"?
  A: The smaller movements within the main structure visible on a lower time frame (the local up/down moves inside the bigger trend).

- Q: What time frames are used in the example to explain structure and substructure?
  A: A higher time frame (daily) and a lower time frame (1 hour).

- Q: How is an uptrend defined in terms of price action?
  A: By a sequence of higher highs and higher lows.

- Q: True or false: Even inside an uptrend on a higher time frame, the lower time frame can show down moves.
  A: True. The lower time frame can have downtrends or pullbacks within the overall uptrend.

- Q: What does the presenter call the smaller trend observed on the lower time frame?
  A: The substructure.

- Q: How can you confirm the relationship between structure and substructure on different time frames?
  A: By comparing a higher time frame (structure) with a lower time frame (substructure) to see how the smaller moves fit into the bigger trend.

- Q: If the higher time frame used is 1 hour, what would be the lower time frame in the example?
  A: 15 minutes (15m).

- Q: If the higher time frame is daily, what are examples of lower time frames shown?
  A: 1 hour (1h) or 15 minutes (15m).

- Q: What tool is suggested for viewing and analyzing these time frames?
  A: TradingView (the charting platform).

- Q: How does the daily time frame typically appear compared to the 1-hour time frame, according to the example?
  A: The daily time frame may show a clear uptrend, whereas the 1-hour time frame shows more frequent pullbacks and consolidation within that uptrend.

- Q: What is the recommended charting exercise for understanding structure and substructure?
  A: Use BTC/USD or EUR/USD on TradingView, set a higher time frame (like daily or 1 hour) and a lower time frame (like 1 hour or 15 minutes), and compare the structure to the substructure.

- Q: What future topic is announced for the next video?
  A: Rally-based vs. drop-based moves.

- Q: What action does the presenter encourage at the end of the video?
  A: Subscribe, like, and share the video to help others learn.

- Q: What additional resource is mentioned for contact or support?
  A: The creator’s WhatsApp contact and the sponsor (PipsyX) mention.

  - Q: What is the basic idea of market structure in this lesson?
  A: Market structure is the overall direction of the market on a higher time frame, with substructure showing the smaller movements on a lower time frame.

- Q: What are structure and substructure in simple terms?
  A: Structure is the main trend seen on a higher time frame; substructure is the smaller trends/movements visible on a lower time frame within that main trend.

- Q: Which time frames are used to explain structure and substructure in this video?
  A: A higher time frame (daily or 1-hour in the example) and a lower time frame (1-hour or 15-minute in the example).

- Q: In the example, what represents a higher high and a higher low?
  A: A higher high is a swing high that is higher than the previous swing high; a higher low is a swing low that is higher than the previous swing low.

- Q: What does the daily time frame show in the BTC example?
  A: The daily time frame shows an uptrend with higher highs and higher lows over time.

- Q: How does the lower time frame (e.g., 1 hour) relate to the higher time frame (e.g., daily) in this context?
  A: The lower time frame shows the substructure: the smaller up-down movements, pullbacks, and consolidations within the larger uptrend seen on the higher time frame.

- Q: Give an example of a substructure movement inside an uptrend.
  A: A move up, then a pullback (down), then another move up within the overall uptrend.

- Q: What is the typical focus for traders regarding structure and substructure?
  A: Traders usually focus on the structure (the higher time frame trend) and sometimes check the substructure on the lower time frame for confirmation.

- Q: What is the difference between structure on the higher time frame and substructure on the lower time frame?
  A: Structure shows the general direction of the market, while substructure shows the intermediate movements and pullbacks within that direction.

- Q: How can you tell which time frame is higher and which is lower in a given setup?
  A: The longer time frame (e.g., 1 hour, daily) is the higher time frame; the shorter time frame (e.g., 15 minutes) is the lower time frame.

- Q: In the example with 1 hour and 15 minutes, which is higher time frame and which is substructure?
  A: The 1 hour is the higher time frame (structure), and the 15 minutes is the lower time frame (substructure).

- Q: What other time frames are mentioned besides daily and 1 hour?
  A: Weekly, monthly, and yearly time frames.

- Q: How can you observe structure and substructure on BTCUSD using charts?
  A: By examining the daily time frame for the overall uptrend (structure) and then switching to a lower time frame like 1 hour to observe the substructure.

- Q: What did the video use to illustrate the difference between daily and hourly movements in BTC?
  A: The daily chart showed a clear uptrend with higher highs and higher lows, while the hourly chart showed up moves with pullbacks and consolidation inside that trend.

- Q: What is the suggested way to practice understanding structure and substructure?
  A: Look at different currency pairs (e.g., EURUSD) on the higher time frame first, then switch to a lower time frame within that same period to observe substructure.

- Q: What tool is repeatedly recommended for viewing charts and time frames?
