## Study Guide: Breaker Block in Breakout Trading

### Key concepts
- Breaker block: The former “other block” that has been broken and flipped, creating a new breakout setup.
- Other block vs. breaker block:
  - Other block: A block that serves as support or resistance (the prior setup before a break).
  - Breaker block: The broken/violated version of the previous block after price breaks through it and retests it from the opposite side.
- Break of structure (BoS): A clear move where price makes a new lower low or higher high, indicating a change in trend direction. Example: in a downtrend, price breaks the previous low; in an uptrend, price breaks the previous high.
- Retest: After a break of a block, price often returns to test the level or block that was broken. If the test holds, the move may continue in the direction of the breakout.
- Demand and supply flip concept:
  - Demand flips to supply and vice versa; a breaker block is identified when an opposite-side block (demand/supply) breaks and then is retested.

### How breaker blocks are formed
- Step 1: Break of structure occurs (price makes a new low in a down move or new high in an up move).
- Step 2: Price breaks a previously held block (the “other block”).
- Step 3: Price retests the broken block from the opposite side and then continues in the breakout direction.
- Result: The broken block becomes a breaker block, signaling a potential breakout trade.

### How to interpret and trade with breaker blocks
- Buy scenario (upward breakout):
  - Price forms a break of structure to the upside.
  - It breaks the nearby block (other block) and then retests that block from the top side.
  - After the retest, price moves higher; consider entering on the retest or after confirmation of the breakout.
- Sell scenario (downward breakout):
  - Price forms a break of structure to the downside.
  - It breaks the nearby block (other block) and then retests that block from beneath.
  - After the retest, price moves lower; consider entering on the retest or after confirmation of the breakout.
- Entry strategies and risk:
  - Conservative approach: place entry after the breakout has occurred and the price retests the breaker area, with stop loss beyond the opposite side of the broken block.
  - Aggressive approach: enter on or just after the break of the block, with a stop loss below/above the breakout range to maximize risk-reward.
  - Risk-reward considerations: high R is possible but breakout trades carry risk if the market reverses; adjust stop loss and position size accordingly.
- Targets:
  - Initial target: the lower/high liquidity below/above the breakout move or the next significant level.
  - Secondary targets: subsequent liquidity zones or a series of retests, depending on your strategy and risk tolerance.

### Relationship to other blocks and patterns
- Support and resistance: Switches around the idea of blocks—breaker block is the breakout version of the previously held block.
- Break of structure must precede a breaker block: A BoS signals the possibility of a new breaker block forming as price moves and tests.

### Practical identification steps (how to spot on charts)
- Look for an uptrend or downtrend with a clear series of higher highs/higher lows (uptrend) or lower lows/lower highs (downtrend).
- Find where price impulsively moves through a block of support or resistance (the “other block”).
- Note if price breaks the block and then returns to retest it from the opposite side.
- Confirm a breaker block when the price fails to hold the retest and resumes in the breakout direction.

### Live chart tips from the guide
- Breakouts often occur when there is a change in market structure (BoS) and the price breaks the adjacent block.
- After a break, look for a retest of the broken block; this retest is your potential entry zone for a trade in the breakout direction.
- Not every breakout will be successful; plan for risk and consider your R risk-reward ratio.

### Assignments and practice
- Go to a chart and identify potential breaker blocks:
  - Mark the previous block (the “other block”) and observe if price breaks it, retests, and continues in the breakout direction.
  - Note where the BoS occurs prior to the breaker block.
  - Determine a potential entry point (retail entry after retest or on breakout) and a stop loss placement.
  - Evaluate risk-reward and how many liquidity zones you could target (TP levels).
- Compare two scenarios:
  - Conservative entry after the retest with wider stop loss.
  - Aggressive entry near the breakout with a tighter stop loss.

### Key takeaways
- Breaker block concept is a natural extension of the idea of blocks: the breaker block is the broken block that flips and can indicate a continuation move after a retest.
- A breaker block forms after a break of structure and a break of the adjacent block, followed by a retest.
- Understanding BoS and how blocks flip helps you identify where to enter on breakouts and how to manage risk.
- Practice by scanning charts for real examples, marking blocks, identifying BoS events, and testing entry ideas with appropriate risk controls.
