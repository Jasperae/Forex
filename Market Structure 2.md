### Study Guide: Demand and Supply Zones (Market Structure 2)

### Key concepts
- Demand Zone
  - A price area where buyers are likely to step in.
  - Generally found in an uptrend.
  - Indicates a potential “point of interest” for entering buy trades.
  - Formed by prior price action patterns (e.g., breaker blocks, other blocks) and trader psychology around those levels.
  - It’s a zone (not a single price); buyers can react within a region around the zone.

- Supply Zone
  - A price area where sellers are likely to step in.
  - Generally found in a downtrend.
  - Indicates a potential selling region or entry for sell trades.
  - Often associated with past market structures such as breaker blocks, other blocks, price gaps, or retracements.
  - Also treated as a zone (not just a single price); multiple price points within the region can trigger selling pressure.

### How demand and supply zones relate to market structure
- In an uptrend, you should observe demand zones as potential buying areas.
- The existence of a demand zone in an uptrend implies there may be a corresponding supply zone in a downtrend (and vice versa) due to the directional psychology of market participants.
- Supply zones can lead to price reaction and can “break the structure” when price moves through them. The video notes that supply zones can sponsor or drive a break of structure in future moves.
- The concepts you’re learning are foundational for later topics like structure, order blocks, sub-structure, and “break of structure” (BOS).

### How to think about these zones (psychology and setup)
- Demand Zone: People expect price to bounce higher after reaching this zone because of previous demand, buyers’ interest, and visible patterns that suggest value at those levels.
- Supply Zone: People expect price to reverse lower after reaching this zone because of selling pressure, previous consolidation, or recognizable blocks indicating resistance.

### Practical notes
- Draw zones, not exact lines. A zone is a region around the area of interest, capturing the idea that price can react within a range.
- Don’t focus only on one line; think in terms of a zone where price action shows confluence of reasons to buy or sell (e.g., nearby blocks, gaps, or other structural features).
- Expect that demand zones in uptrends and supply zones in downtrends correlate with the broader market structure; they help explain why price moves as it does.

### What this video covers and what to expect next
- This video introduces the basic definitions and the intuitive psychology behind demand and supply zones.
- It suggests that future videos will cover more on market structure, order blocks, and how these zones interact with “break of structure” events.
- Tomorrow’s content will dive into structure and sub-structure terms (e.g., order blocks, OB structures) in more detail.

### Study tips and quick quiz
- Define in your own words:
  - What is a demand zone?
  - What is a supply zone?
- Given an uptrend, where would you expect to find a demand zone? Why?
- In a downtrend, where would you expect to find a supply zone? Why?
- How does a supply zone relate to a break of structure in future price action?
- True or false: A demand zone is a precise, single price point. Explain your answer.

### Short glossary
- Demand Zone: Price region where buyers are expected to enter; typical in uptrends; a zone rather than a single price.
- Supply Zone: Price region where sellers are expected to enter; typical in downtrends; a zone rather than a single price.
- Break of Structure (BOS): A move that breaks through a previous market structure, often associated with the influence of a supply or demand zone.
- Block / Breaker Block: Price action patterns used to identify potential zones and confluence points for buyer/seller interest (to be covered in future videos).

### If you want to go deeper
- Look for how demand zones and supply zones are formed from specific patterns like breaker blocks and other blocks.
- Explore how these zones interact with overall market structure (uptrends vs. downtrends) and how they contribute to reversals or consolidations.
- Prepare to study order blocks and sub-structures in upcoming lessons to see how these concepts integrate with BOS analysis.

- Front: What does a demand zone indicate about potential buyers?
  Back: It indicates a point of interest where many buyers may enter the market, often driving price up.

  Back: It indicates a point of interest where many sellers may enter the market, often driving price down.

- Front: How does a demand zone relate to future price movement (in relation to break of structure)?
  Back: The demand zone is where buyers push the price, potentially causing a break of structure from a previous level.

  Back: The supply zone is where sellers cause price to move down, potentially leading to a break of structure in the opposite direction.
